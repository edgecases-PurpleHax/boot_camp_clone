- How can this information be helpful to an attacker: **A hacker can target them with social engineering attacks**.


#### Step 2: DNS and Domain Discovery

Enter the IP address for `demo.testfire.net` into Domain Dossier and answer the following questions based on the results:

  1. Where is the company located: **Sunnyvale, CA**

  2. What is the NetRange IP address: `65.61.137.64 - 65.61.137.127`

  3. What is the company they use to store their infrastructure: **Rackspace Backbone Engineering**

    - `443 Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine`
    - `8080 Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine`
    - `8443 Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine`

#### Step 4: Recon-ng

- Install the Recon module `xssed`. 
- Set the source to `demo.testfire.net`. 
- Run the module. 

Is Altoro Mutual vulnerable to XSS: **Yes**

Solution:

```
[recon-ng][default] > modules load recon/domains-vulnerabilities/xssed
[recon-ng][default][xssed] > options set SOURCE demo.testfire.net
SOURCE => demo.testfire.net
[recon-ng][default][xssed] > run

### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: `nmap -sV 192.168.0.10`
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`: `nmap -sV -oN zenmapscan.txt --script smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10`

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: `nmap --script smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10`

Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:

  1. What is the vulnerability: `Anonymous users have read/write access to their SAMBA shares.`

  2. Why is it dangerous: `Anonymous users can access company files and change them.`

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommend for the client to protect their server: `Update their SAMBA server to the newest version and disable anonymous access.`
