#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues]((https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

* **Detailed Location of the issue.** Please include a markdown link to where the problem is. State where the issue is. E.G - Lesson, Activity, Homework, timetracker, or slideshow.

* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. Be sure to list steps you took to encounter the problem if applicable.

* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

If relevant (e.g. when setting up software, or having inconsistencies across different setups) include details about your configuration and environment:

* What's the name and version of the OS you're using?

e.g.
```
#### There is a typo in the Lesson Plan for Cryptography Unit, Day 2, section 5

* Title - Typo in Lesson Plan

* Body - `[Lesson Plan 2.1](www.somewhere.com)` I was in the Lesson Plan 2.1 and in section 5. It says `I am dancing on wolves`. It should be `I am dancing with wolves`.
```

* Keep in mind that GitHub allows users to drop images into the comment box.

### Making Content Contributions

You can also update and enhance the curriculum content directly, but we strongly recommend that you raise an issue first with this suggestion or enhancement so that we can see it and discuss before you dive into the work.
