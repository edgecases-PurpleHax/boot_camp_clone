## Technical Lab Setup

Technical labs begin in Week 3 of the program. The majority of the following weeks are hands-on. 

We will use a combination of local and cloud-hosted VMs, with certain weeks using our local Vagrant virtual machine solution and other weeks using our cloud-hosted solution on Azure Lab Services. 


### Local Virtual Machine

You and students will use a Vagrant virtual machine in the following units: 
* Unit 3: Terminal
* Unit 4: Linux Systems Administration
* Unit 5: Linux Archiving and Logging Data
* Unit 6: Bash Scripting and Programming
* Unit 8: Networks I
* Unit 9: Networks II
* Unit 10: Cryptography
* Unit 14: Web Development
* Unit 15: Web Vulnerabilities
* Unit 18: SIEM I
* Unit 19: SIEM II

#### Distributing Virtual Machines

- In Unit 1, Day 1, you will remind students to complete their installations from prework so they can download the virtual machine during the next class. The specific tools they will need installed are Vagrant and VirtualBox. Windows users will also need Git Bash installed.  

- In Unit 1, Day 2, you will demonstrate how to download and run the files that will install the virtual machine. We ask that you demonstrate this to students, as many will have no familiarity with the command line or installing script files.

- Please use office hours following this class and throughout Week 2 to make sure all students are set up with the local virtual machine. Be prepared to troubleshoot and help students, as there may be setup issues due to individual computer specs. 

You and students will start using the virtual machine in class in Unit 3, Day 1. 

**Note:** We use Vagrant because it allows us to distribute updates, which students can easily pull by running simple commands. 


### Azure Lab Services

Some weeks require environments with multiple machines. We host these technical labs on Microsoft Azure, which you and students will first use during the Windows unit in Week 7. You will use Azure Lab Services for the following units:

  * Unit 7: Windows
  * Unit 11: Network Security
  * Unit 16: Penetration Testing I
  * Unit 17: Penetration Testing II
  * Unit 20: Project 2
  * Unit 21: Forensics
  * Unit 24: Final Project

Please refer to the Azure Training Sequence in the GitHub curriculum repository for detailed documentation and troubleshooting help. 

#### Distributing Azure Access and Credentials

- By Lesson 6.2, the curriculum team will add unique Azure login credentials and the first registration link for the Windows lab environment to a university-specific spreadsheet. 

  * [Find your your university-specific spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uHVzvVQftHL4CkUOB03lNelf-kLToZys6ugsIoVOpE0/edit#gid=0). Please request view access from your SSM. 

  * Please verify that credentials for all instructors, students, and TAs are in the sheet. If they are not, please reach out the curriculum team.

  * Please copy the login credentials to a new sheet. You will distribute this to students at the end of Lesson 6.3. 

- During Lesson 6.3, you will demonstrate to students how to set up Azure. Please follow the steps in the lesson plan very carefully. After the demonstration, distribute the login credentials to students. Please use office hours after class to make sure everyone is setup with Azure. 

- In Unit 7: Windows, you and students will use Azure for the first time. 

- Please note that new lab environments require new registration links, which will be added to the spreadsheet prior to the week you will use the lab environment. 

- Please share the registration link with students prior to the week they will use the environment. Have everyone click the registration link and verify that the new lab environment appears in their Azure dashboard. This way, everyone will be set up with the appropriate lab environment prior to the start of the unit. 

  - For example, students will use the Network Security lab in Unit 11. In Lesson 10.3, you will distribute the Network Security Azure registration link to students. 

- Please make sure to go through the **Up and Running with Azure** training sequence prior to Unit 7. 


### Personal Azure Accounts

You and students will use personal Azure accounts in the following units: 
* Unit 12: Cloud Security 
* Unit 13: Project 1

#### Personal Azure Account Setup for Students 

- In Unit 11, Day 3, students will create free, personal Azure accounts. You should do this as well. You can find a setup guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gs_09b7eotl7hzTL82xlqPt-OwOd0aWA78qcQxtMr6Y/edit). 

- In Unit 12, you and students will use your personal Azure accounts. Please make sure everyone is logged into these accounts and on `portal.azure.com`  No one should be logged into their cyberxsecurity accounts. 

- In Unit 13, you and students will continue to use these personal Azure accounts for the first project week.
