### 01. Instructor Do: Introduction to Day 3 of Certification Test Prep Week (0:05)

Welcome students back to class and explain that today we will be covering the CEH and CISSP certifications.

Before we dive into these certifications, let's review the topics taught in the last class:

- The Security+ exam is broken up into five primary domains:
  - 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
  - 2.0 Architecture and Design 
  - 3.0 Implementation
  - 4.0 Operations and Incident Response
  - 5.0 Governance, Risk, and Compliance 

- There are two topics on the exam which contain questions within several subdomains that were not covered in detail in our course:

  - Architecture and Design
  - Identity and Access Management

Emphasize to the class that they should plan to start studying for the Security+ exam shortly after this course ends.
 
  - The sooner they take the exam, the more they will be able to retain from the course and the more likely they will be to succeed.

Once students complete Security+, they may wonder which certifications they should pursue next. 
       
- The answer varies for each student, depending on their desired area of focus and how many years of experience they have in the field. 
 

 - Two of the most popular information security certifications that cyber professionals take after the Security+ exam are CEH and CISSP.
   
Explain that during the first half of the class we will introduce these two certifications, their requirements and prerequisites, details of the exam, topics covered, as well as several sample questions.   

In the second half of the class, we will return to the Kahoot quiz format to review sample questions from these exams.

Ask the class if they have any questions before continuing to the next section.

### 02. Instructor Do: Intro to Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) (0:10)

Explain that CEH certifications are issued by EC-Council.

According to EC-Council:

- The test is three hours long and consists of 100-150 questions.   
  - Once you complete a question, you cannot adjust the answer.

  - Question types are multiple choice and drag-and-drop, referred to as advanced innovative questions.

- If you pass, you will not receive your exact score, only a notification that you passed.
  - If you do not pass the exam, you will receive your score.

  
#### CISSP Prerequisites

- Option 1 - CISSP Credentials: If you currently have five years of information security experience in two of the eight domains listed, you can register to take the exam. Note that one year can be replaced with relevant completed education.  

  - After passing the exam, you have nine months to complete your endorsement, in which an (ISC)² certified professional attests to your professional experience.

  - Once the endorsement is approved by (ISC)², you are granted your CISSP credentials.
  
- Option 2 - Associate CISSP Credentials: If you currently do not have the five years of information security experience in two of the eight domains listed, you can still take the exam.

  - After passing the exam, you will be granted an Associate CISSP certification.

  - Once you have met the professional requirements of five years in two of the eight domains, you can begin the endorsement process.


#### CISSP-Specific Tips

- Begin preparing at least three months before the exam. 

- Use mnemonics to help study. For example, for the OSI layers: **P**lease **D**o **N**ot **T**ouch **S**teve's **P**et **A**lligator 

- Consider taking the (ISC)² one-week boot camp course to prepare for the exam.
  
- Answer questions as if you were the CISO of an organization.

Pose this example question to the class:

```
An organization with 130 employees using symmetric encryption is considering moving to asymmetric encryption. How would this affect their number of keys?

A. 260 more keys
B. 8,000 fewer keys
C. 5,605 more keys
D. 8,125 fewer keys

```

The answer is D. The organization would have 8,125 fewer keys:

- Symmetric Formula = n(n - 1)/2 
  
    130 * 129 / 2 = 8,385
    
- Asymmetric Formula = n * 2
  
  130 * 2 = 260 

- Difference: 
  
  8,385 - 260 = (D) 8,125 fewer keys


In the next activity, you students will complete a mini quiz on topics covered in the CISSP exam.

  - The purpose of this quiz is to demonstrate the types of topics and questions they may encounter on the CISSP exam.

Ask the class if they have any questions before proceeding to the activity.
