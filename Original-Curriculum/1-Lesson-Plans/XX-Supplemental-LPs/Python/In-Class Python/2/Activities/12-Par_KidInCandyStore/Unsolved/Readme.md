## Kid in a Candy Store


* In this activity, you are a kid in a candy store with your parents. 

  * There is a specific selection of candies, and each candy costs $1. 
  * You have an allowance of $5. 
  * You will select 5 candies, and once you’ve chosen all of them, the terminal will print a message of what candies you brought home.


#### Instruction

* Below is the code required in the script file. 
  
* Print out the list of candies provided to you in the file along with their index numbers stored in brackets beside them.
   * To do this, create a loop that prints all of the candies in the store to the terminal with their index stored in brackets beside them.
   * **Example:** `"[0] Snickers"`.
 * ***Note:*** This has been already completed in the script file. 

* Then print out a prompt that asks “Which candy would you like to bring home?” The user will have to input the index associated with the candy. This prompt will run until all 5 choices have been made.
    * To do this, create a loop that runs for a number of times as determined by the variable `allowance`. 
    * **Example:** If allowance is equal to five, the loop should run five times.
    * Each time this second loop runs, take in a user's input, preferably a number, and then add the candy with a matching index to the variable `candyCart`.
    * **Example:** If the user enters "0" as their input, "Snickers" should be added into the `candyCart` list.

* Print out a statement that says which candies the user brought home with them.
    * To do this, create another loop to print all of the candies selected to the terminal.

* **Bonus:** Create a version of the same code which allows a user to select as much candy as they want up until they say they do not want any more.
