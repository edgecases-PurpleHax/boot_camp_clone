# Variable Addresses

In this activity, you will be creating some simple variables for a website and its daily hits in order to then print out a summary of this information to the screen.

## Instructions

  * Create a variable called `URL` which will contain a URL in string form.

  * Create a variable called `IP_address` which will contain an IP address in string form.

  * Create a new variable for each weekday and, using integers, set them equal to how many hits the site got on those days. **Note:** You can use an arbitrary number for each.

  * Create a variable called `weekly_hits` and set it equal to the sum of the hits on each day of the week.

  * Create a variable called `average_hits` which takes the weekly_hits and divides it by the number of weekdays in a week.

  * Print out each variable to the terminal. **Note:** Remember to *cast* your integer variables as strings when printing!
