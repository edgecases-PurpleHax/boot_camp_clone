# Exercise â€” Presentations

## Instructions
Welcome back!

In this exercise, you'll develop BCP and DR plans for _Geldcorp_.  You'll work with a group of consultants, and each group will develop a plan for a different domain of the company.

In particular, you'll develop plans for one of the following realms:
- **Physical Environment**
- **Personnel**
- **Network**
- **Technology**
- **Security**

You should specify both a BCP and DR plan. The BCP plan will be for mild-to-moderate incidents, in which the business suffers damage but can maintain operations. The DR plan will be for situations where the business suffers a catastrophic incident that must be contained before operations can continue.

You'll summarize your plan in a Google Slides presentation. Your BCP and DR plans should cover the following:
- **Points and Modes of Failure**
  - Identify 2 points of failure or security weakness, and one major threat for each.
- **Projected Damages**: Explain how the business would be affected in the event each threat were realized.
- **Continuity/Recovery Plan**: For BCP, how the business could "patch" a mild/moderate incident to maintain operations during. For DR, explain how the business should prioritize its resources to recover from the reputational and operational damage of a catastrophic loss.

Use the information below to complete the slides. Read all of it, but only use the information relevant to your group's domain to create your plan.

Be sure to ask your instructors for help if you get stuck.

**Good luck!**
