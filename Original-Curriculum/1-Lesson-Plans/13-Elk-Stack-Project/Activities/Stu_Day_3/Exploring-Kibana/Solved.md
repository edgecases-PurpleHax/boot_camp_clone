         ![](Images/404-503.png)

    - In the last 7 days, what country produced the majority of the traffic on the website?

        - **Example Answer:** China

          ![](Images/most-traffic.png)

          ![](Images/most-traffic2.png)

    - Of the traffic that's coming from that country, what time of day had the highest amount of activity?

        - **Example Answer:** 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. (hours 12 and 13)

         ![](Images/hour-day.png)

    - List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).

        - **Example Answer:**

            - **gz:** `.gz` files are compressed files created using the gzip compression utility.

            - **css:** `.css` files can help define font, size, color, spacing, border and location of HTML information on a webpage. They are downloaded with their `.html` counterparts and rendered by the browser.

            - **zip:** A lossless compression format. A `.zip` file may contain one or more files or directories that have been compressed.

            - **deb:** A file with the `.deb` file extension is a Debian (Linux) Software Package file. These files are installed when using the `apt` package manager.

            - **rpm:** `.rpm` file formats are a Red Hat Software Package file. RPM stands for Red Hat Package Manager.

3. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.

    ![](Images/visitors-vs-bytes.png)

    - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).

    - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?

        **Example Answer:** (Your results may be different.) In our example, it seems strange that _one_ visitor is using a number of bytes that is considerably higher than all other usage.

    - What OS was the source machine running?

        - **Example Answer:** Windows 8
    
    - What is the full URL that was accessed?

        - **Example Answer:** https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat/metricbeat-6.3.2-i686.rpm
    
    - From what website did the visitor's traffic originate?

       ![](Images/url-fb.png)

6. Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights.

    - What do you think the user was doing?

        - **Example Answer:** This event appears to be a user downloading a Linux package from the website being monitored. 

    - Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?

        - Linux packages aren't typically malicious, but they could be. Depending on the website, this could be harmless traffic from a sysadmin performing an update.

    - Was there anything that seems suspicious about this activity? 
    - Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidelines?

        - **Example Answer:** The main concern is the referral link from Facebook, as it's probably not within compliance to post package update links on Facebook.

        - This user could be further investigated and monitored for suspicious activity.
