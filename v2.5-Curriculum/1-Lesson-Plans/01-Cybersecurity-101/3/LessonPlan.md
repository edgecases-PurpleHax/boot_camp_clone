## 1.3 Lesson Plan: Surveying the Cyberspace 

### Overview

Today's class focuses on professional pathways. Students will get an overview of cybersecurity certifications, domains, and professions, and an in-depth review of the Security+ exam.  

### Class Objectives

By the end of class students will be able to:

- Consider roles and career pathways within the cybersecurity space.

- Explain the landscape of certifications available to security professionals.

- Explore what the Security+ exam is and which InfoSec pathways benefit from the certification.


### Instructor Notes

- This class, especially the domain and career-oriented sections, will ask students to think about their desired career goals and areas of interest. It is completely fine if students do not have a specific career pathway that they're interested in. This boot camp will present a wide scope of cybersecurity skills and domains, allowing students to narrow down what interests and motivates them. 

- Use any opportunity to provide personal experiences and examples from your own career.  

- If time remains in class after introducing the first Challenge, an optional **"Fireside Chat"** activity has been provided.

### 01. Instructor Do: Welcome and Today's Themes (0:05)

Welcome students to the third day of class. We've only just scratched the surface of cybersecurity, but we have covered *a lot*. Today we'll continue to expand this scope by examining various cybersecurity domains, careers, and certifications. 

- Explain that students shouldn't feel pressured to know exactly what career path they want to pursue after this boot camp. Once students are exposed to the various skills, concepts, and domains covered in the various units of this course, they will have a better idea. For now, we'll start by discussing the high-level domains that exist in the cybersecurity industry. 

- Students will also have an opportunity to search various job platforms to get a sense of the current cybersecurity hiring landscape. 

- Finally, we'll cover certifications. We will specifically go over the Security+ certification and answer a few practice questions. 

Before we dive in, let's review some concepts we covered over the past two days. 

### 02. Instructor Do: Quick Review (0:05)

Using the slideshow as a guide, review and discuss the topics from the previous lesson:

- Discuss how nearly every single node of a web application—the webpage, server, database, even the users and administrators—can be targeted by a cybercriminal. 

- Then, find out if students can name some different kinds of attacks that cybercriminals use to target these nodes.

- Cover some of the primary methods used by cybersecurity professionals to prevent cybercriminals from compromising an application or its users.


### 03. Instructor Do: Cybersecurity Domains (0:15)

Start this section with a quote from Tao Security's Richard Bejtlich on entering the cybersecurity field:

- _Providing advice on “getting started in digital security” is similar to providing advice on “getting started in medicine.” If you ask a neurosurgeon he or she may propose some sort of experiment with dead frog legs and batteries. If you ask a dermatologist you might get advice on protection from the sun whenever you go outside. Asking a “security person” will likewise result in many different responses, depending on the individual’s background and tastes._ [Source: TaoSecurity](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2017/03/cybersecurity-domains-mind-map.html)

Explain to the class that the field of cybersecurity is so vast that it is often hard to get straightforward advice on how to enter the industry. This is because the advice of each professional will vary depending on their background and tastes.

- Add specific examples around this if you can.

Point out that the cyber domains map in the slides shows various cybersecurity domains and roles, and discuss some of these domains. You are welcome to modify or add to these descriptions with your own professional experiences and examples. Students want to hear about your perspective, and specific examples will add more depth to these descriptions.

- **Security architecture**: A unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible. ([Source](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-cybersecurity-a/9780134772929/))

- **Security operations**: The process that identifies critical information to determine if friendly actions can be observed by enemy intelligence and if information obtained by adversaries could be useful to them, and then executes selected measures that eliminates or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly critical information. ([Source](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_13_3.pdf))

- **Governance**: The framework for managing performance and risk, oversight of compliance and control responsibilities, and defining the cyber mission by mapping the structure, authority, and processes to create an effective program. ([Source](https://bluelance.com/cybersecurity-governance))

- **Physical security**: The protection of personnel, hardware, software, networks, and data from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an enterprise, agency, or institution. This includes protection from fire, flood, natural disasters, burglary, theft, vandalism, and terrorism. ([Source](https://books.google.com/books/about/HIMSS_Dictionary_of_Healthcare_Informati.html?id=AEowBQAAQBAJ))

- **Threat intelligence**: Evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications, and actionable advice, about an existing or emerging threat to assets, which can be used to inform decisions about responding to that threat. ([Source](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/2487216/definition-threat-intelligence))

- **Career development**: Training of future cybersecurity professionals.

- **Risk assessment**: Analyzing what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, what the potential consequences are, and how tolerable the identified risk is.

- **User education**: Teaching users how to protect themselves from cyberattacks by informing them of risks, exploits, and external threats as well as teaching them the skills needed to combat common attacks.

- **Frameworks and standards**: The creation of new security frameworks and practices for professionals to follow. 

Our program is primarily concerned with the technical aspects of cybersecurity, but we will connect these areas to the overall security organization and business.

- We'll dive deep into security operations and security architecture in this course. We'll also explore penetration testing, and discuss red team vs. blue team in depth.

- Governance and risk assessment are two of the main topics we'll cover next week. We'll also discuss the importance of user education and training. We'll discuss physical security tools like key cards, and the implementation of disaster recovery planning.

- Throughout this course, we will discuss different frameworks and standards. It is important to understand how these affect the development and priorities of a security organization. It's also important to note that different industries follow different frameworks, which we'll discuss next week. 

Ask students if they have any questions before proceeding.

### 04. Student Do: Cybersecurity Careers Research (0:10)

Explain the following to students:

- In the next activity, we'll explore security careers and pathways in depth.

- We'll start by conducting some career research.

Send students the following activity file: 

- [Activity File: Cybersecurity Careers Research](Activities/04_Careers/Readme.md)

### 05. Facilitated Discussion: Cybersecurity Careers Research (0:20)

:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 


Begin by asking students to share answers to the above questions on search terms, job descriptions, and skills and qualifications. Either throughout this discussion or after it, mention the following:

It's important for you to assess your existing skills and job level:
 
- Are you a career switcher or starter? Are you entering the security field for the first time? 

- If you have existing experience, what is it? Possibilities include:
  - Technical cybersecurity-adjacent fields, such as IT and networking. 
  - Technical experience, such as software development.
  - Security experience, such as SOC operations, security analysis, and security risk analysis and policy.

Similar job titles can have different skills and qualifications, so it's important to review the specifics of a job description. 

- You'll notice that many jobs, such as security analyst, don't necessarily expect candidates to have a lot of specific skills and tools. Many companies are open to teaching employees on the job. What's important is showing your passion as well as ability and willingness to learn. 

- Passion and ability to learn is key. This program will push you past your comfort zone, but *learning how to learn* is a critical skill that employers search for. 

  - Also, always stay curious and keep up to date on cybersecurity news and trends. Complete projects and participate in activities like CTFs (Capture the Flag competitions). In interviews, you should be able to discuss and demonstrate your passion and how you learn. 

- Do not be deterred by jobs that require a few more years of experience than what you have. If you are just starting out, a job that requires six to eight years of experience is most likely not a possibility, but a job that requires two years of experience is often possible. 

  - Employers will often intentionally put more years of experience than is actually needed in order to avoid too many applicants. 

Share the following statistics:

- According to [the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm), there will be a 33% growth in employment for Information Security Analysts between the years 2020 and 2030. 

- A similar report by [ISACA](https://www.silensec.com/downloads-menu/whitepapers/item/download/10_d3d9446802a44259755d38e6d163e820#:~:text=In%20their%202016%20report%5B2,open%20security%20jobs%20are%20qualified.) found that:
  - 53% of organizations experience delays as long as 6 months to find qualified cybersecurity candidates.
  - Cybersecurity jobs grew 3 times as quickly as IT jobs between 2010-2014.  
  - 84% of organizations believe that 50% or fewer of applicants for their open security jobs are qualified.

 
- Also, according to (ISC)², 87% of all cybersecurity professionals started their careers in a different field. This means that the majority of cybersecurity professionals have backgrounds similar to students.

Transition to a discussion of career pathways and explain that, while it’s possible to jump between levels, in general the cybersecurity industry wants candidates with proven experience when hiring. If you’re new to the field, you will need to put in work to get started.

- However, it's important to note that because of the increased demand for security professionals, you can probably skip some of the years of required experience for certain jobs. We have had complete beginners in our program get jobs as network administrators, SOC analysts, and security analysts after completing the program. 

- Point out that we'll now discuss common job titles and where they fit in different pathways.

  - **IT support specialists,** **computer help desk specialists**, and other similar titles are entry level jobs for all cybersecurity domains. 
    
  - **Systems administrator** and **network administrator** jobs are also entry level jobs in the networking space. 
    
      - Technical cybersecurity roles require a strong foundation in networking, which our program covers. We also provide relevant cybersecurity context to our networking modules, so they are still relevant for those who already have sysadmin or networking experience. These roles are within reach for career switchers and starters.
    
      - Networking roles focus on configuring and maintaining networks, and often include security-related tasks such as monitoring logs, implementing firewalls, and maintaining network-based backups. 

  - A range of entry level security jobs focus on the operations and defensive side of security. Our program will equip you with the skills to be hired in these roles, like many of our graduates.
  
    - **SOC analysts** are the most common entry-level security jobs. Specifically Tier 1 SOC analysts can be hired with no prior professional experience. They work at a security operations center (SOC) within an organization, monitoring and analyzing network traffic. 
      - They are the first level of defense and responsible for monitoring the security of users, systems, and the network. They detect and investigate suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the network and within systems.
  
    - **Security or information specialists/analysts** encompass different skill levels and responsibilities, so it is important to always review the job description, specific skills, and qualifications. These roles actively protect an organization from security threats and breaches. 
      - Common responsibilities for entry-level roles include keeping up to date with security improvements, monitoring and protecting security systems, implementing security tools and protocols, developing security requirements, analyzing security policies and protocols for weaknesses and flaws, and designing and developing training. 
  
    - **Information assurance technicians** protect computer assets by establishing and documenting access and maintaining files.
  
    - **Forensics specialists** come in after a crime has been committed. They analyze logs and other data to determine what occurred. 
      - Some common responsibilities include conducting security incident investigations, recovering and examining data from computers and other devices, compiling evidence for legal cases, writing technical reports, preparing evidence for trial, and working with law enforcement on the validity and preservation of data. 
    
    - **Risk analysts** use their knowledge and experience to examine systems and procedures to identify potential adverse events, including hardware and software crashes, physical disasters, malicious intruders, malware, denial of service attacks, and employee misconduct. 
    
    - **IT auditors** are responsible for the internal controls and risks to a company’s technology network. This role includes identifying the weaknesses in a system's network and creating an action plan to prevent security breaches in the technology.

  - Typically, with some years of experience in the above roles, people can move on to mid-level to advanced roles such as the ones that follow. Many mid-level and advanced-level roles may also require additional certifications. 
    
    - **Security engineers** test the network for vulnerabilities, monitor for security breaches, and develop security plans and policies. 
      - Common responsibilities include installing and configuring firewalls and intrusion detection systems, performing vulnerability testing and security assessments, evaluating new technologies, testing existing security solutions, and defining, implementing, and maintaining security policies. 
      
      - Many of these responsibilities are similar to those of a security analyst, but are more advanced and often more technical.
    
    - **Penetration testers** or **ethical hackers** are often hired by a company to test and break into their security controls and defenses and identify and report vulnerabilities and flaws in a system, using specific tools to simulate cyberattacks. 
      - Their goal is to help companies improve their security posture. Pentesters need to deeply understand the types of systems they’re trying to break into. They usually specialize in specific systems, such as networks, web applications, and mobile applications. 

  - **Chief Information Officers (CIO)** and **Chief Information Security Officers (CISO)** are advanced managerial roles in cybersecurity. Certifications such as CISSP+ are often required.

### 06. Instructor Do: Using Our Career Services Department (0:05) 

Explain that the Career Services department is available for students from the first day of the program.

- During class, you will tie concepts and skills in with career outcomes and roles. The Career Services team will help you do the practical, hard work of obtaining a new role or promotion.

- There are several career milestones for you to complete that you'll find in Bootcamp Spot.

  - You can access them all now and submit milestones whenever you want during the program.

  - However, you will need to submit at least one milestone in order to unlock Career Services.

  - One of the milestones, an updated, polished resume, will be a requirement in one of our later Challenge assignments, but you can submit this earlier if you'd like.

  - Review the slides on Becoming Employer Competitive, Working with Your Profile Coach, and Working with Your Career Director.

- Let students know that this week's Challenge will contain more details on Career Services. If students do not know who their Career Director is, they should reach out to their Student Success Manager.

### 07. Break (0:15)

-------

### 08. Instructor Do: Cybersecurity Certifications (0:10)

Explain that as the demand for cybersecurity careers grows, employers frequently use certification as a measure of employee qualifications and training when hiring.

- Emphasize that if students are serious about advancing their careers in security, certifications will be an important step towards more opportunity, knowledge, and skills.  Certifications can be used across jobs and organizations.

- Note that it is possible to get an entry-level security job without any certifications. For example, an SOC analyst is a common job that often does not require any certifications. For career starters, many networking jobs, such as systems or network administrators, also do not require certifications. 

:question: **Ask class**: Pose a few questions to the class to gauge their knowledge of and interest in certifications:

- Which certifications do you know about?

- Which certifications are you interested in pursuing?


Explain that certifications are obtained through accrediting organizations. Here is a list of top providers, with a few of the certifications they offer:


- CompTIA: Security+, PenTest+
- GIAC: GPEN, GCIH
- (ISC)²: CISSP, SSCP
- Offensive Security: OSCP, OSWP
- EC Council: CEH, ECIH

Most of these organizations offer both introductory certifications and more advanced specialization certifications.

 - According to Wikipedia, as of early 2019 there are over 100 security certifications available to cybersecurity professionals. 

  - Share the following list of certifications over Slack:
    - [Wikipedia: Computer Security Certifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_security_certifications)

Have students spend a few minutes reviewing the list. Point out that it identifies certification details related to specific criteria, such as issuing organization, focus, cost, and more. Also, point out how many specializations and associated certifications exist within cybersecurity.

- Inform students that today's class will focus only on the Security+ exam. Additionally, point out that many of the topics in this course will help prepare them for this exam. 

### 09. Instructor Do: Introduction to Security+ Certification (0:10)

Emphasize that while this class explores the importance of the cybersecurity certifications, this course is *not* a test prep course. This course will offer an exam voucher and practice resources for the Security+ exam, but to be properly prepared to take the exam, students will have to learn other topics and practice extensively on their own. 

Review the following questions about the CompTIA Security+ certification:

#### What is the Security+ certification?

* According to CompTIA: "Security+ is the first security certification IT professionals should earn. It establishes the core knowledge required of any cybersecurity role and provides a springboard to intermediate-level cybersecurity jobs. Security+ incorporates best practices in hands-on troubleshooting to ensure security professionals have practical security problem-solving skills. Cybersecurity professionals with Security+ know how to address security incidents—not just identify them."

#### What are some jobs that may require the Security+ certification?

   - Security architect
   
   - Security engineer
   
   - Security consultant
   
   - Security specialist
   
   - Information security analyst

Explain that as of August 2020, the average annual pay for an information security analyst in the United States was $99,944 per year. ([Source](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Information-Security-Analyst-Salary))

#### What skills and knowledge areas are assessed in this certification?

Note the following domains covered in the exam:
  
  - Threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities
  
  - Technologies and tools
  
  - Architecture and design
  
  - Identity and access management
  
  - Risk management
  
  - Cryptography and PKI (public key infrastructure)

Explain that we will cover many aspects of these topics throughout the program. Today's class will specifically focus on the first domain. Throughout the course, we will emphasize which topics and skills covered in class are also relevant to the Security+ exam.

- Emphasize that students will still need to study topics in depth outside of class to prepare for the certification.

#### At which point in my career should I consider taking the Security+ exam?

- Security+ is considered an entry-level exam. The skills that you learn in this program will provide a foundation that you can build on to prepare for the exam. 

- In class, we will do lots of practical work and go in-depth in several topics, but the Security+ exam is more broad and requires knowledge in areas that we do not cover in this program.

- For these gaps, you will get access to a question-based tool called CertMaster Practice, which will provide the necessary coverage needed to master the exam. 

#### Why are all the topics in the Sec+ exam not covered in our program? 

Again, this boot camp is not a test prep course. 
- We don't cover every topic discussed in the Security+ exam because our program focuses on providing hands-on experience with the most common concepts, tools, and technologies used in security and networking.

- What the course _does_ cover provides you with knowledge that will be relevant to almost any security job you'll apply to, as well as a framework that makes it easy to learn new protocols and tools when you encounter them in your studies and work.

- Some topics on the Security+ exam are left out because they are highly specific and relevant either only to the test or to specific subfields of cybersecurity. As such, they contribute little to foundational, general knowledge. 

    - For example, the TACACS+ protocol appears on the Security+ exam, but only engineers who work specifically with Cisco devices use it.

- These topics are left out so you can spend the majority of the course learning the tools and concepts that will prepare you to succeed in the _largest number of jobs_, and to learn any networking/security concepts you encounter.

Ask the class if they have any questions about the certification before you begin discussing the exam.


### 10. Instructor Do: Introduction to Security+ Certification Exam  (0:10)

Cover the following details about the exam: 

- The test consists of 90 multiple-choice and performance-based questions.

- Test takers will have 90 minutes to complete the exam. 

- The passing score is 750 (on a scale of 100-900).

- The cost of the exam is $339.00, but all students will receive a free exam voucher at the end of the program. 


Breakdown of the domains by percent:

```
Domain                               | Weight   ||  
==================================================
Attacks, Threats and Vulnerabilities | (24%) ||
Architecture and Design | (21%) ||
Implementation | (25%) ||
Operations and Incident Response  | (16%) ||
Governance, Risk and Compliance  | (14%) ||


Total                                |100%      ||     
```




Explain that there are two types of questions on the exams: multiple choice and performance based.

* Review with the students the following examples of each question format.

**Multiple Choice Example:**

1. Which of the following describes a logic bomb?

    a. A program that performs a malicious activity at a specific time or after triggering an event.

    b. A type of malicious code similar to a virus whose primary purpose is to duplicate itself and spread, while not necessarily internally damaging or destroying resources.

    c. A program that appears to be a legitimate application, utility, game, or screensaver that performs malicious activities surreptitiously.

    d. A program that has no useful purpose, but attempts to spread itself to other systems and often damages resources on the system where it is found.

 After asking for some answers, point out that the correct answer is **A**.


**Performance Based Example:**

Explain that performance-based questions (PBQs) test your ability to solve problems in a simulated environment. Unlike multiple-choice questions, they often entail more complicated tasks such as sequencing steps, choosing multiple answers from a set of options, or matching multiple concepts to their definitions. 

- Guide the students through an example PBQ question around security policy.

  - Scenario: You are responsible for security at a small organization and have been tasked with implementing a security policy. Place the following steps of organizing a security policy in their appropriate order. Note that there are five options, but you need to choose four.    
  
     Step 1 _______ > Step 2 _______ > Step 3 _______ > Step 4 _______
    
   - Possible choices: 
      - Obtain support and commitment from management. 
      - Analyze risks to security.
      - Secure budgeting.
      - Review, test, and update procedures.
      - Implement appropriate controls. 

    - Point out to students that on the actual exam they will drag and drop the answer options in the appropriate order. 

    - Collaboratively work with students on this problem and try to work toward the correct answer. Point out that we'll explore this topic in more depth in the next week. 

  - Correct answer:
      - Step 1: Obtain support and commitment from management.
      - Step 2: Analyze risks to security.
      - Step 3: Implement appropriate controls. 
      - Step 4: Review, test, and update procedures.

- Provide other examples of PBQs that students might encounter on the Security+ exam and explain that we'll cover many of these terms in later modules.

  1.  You are in charge of creating an incident response process for your company. Match the given actions (not mentioned in this example) with the correct phase of the IR plan.

      - The phases are: Preparation, Identification/Detection, Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery.

  2. You are in charge of deploying public key infrastructure (PKI) into your environment, and for this you need to have a good foundation in cryptographic technology. Match the appropriate terminology with the function it's used for. 
      - The terms are: public key, private key, hash, digital signature.

  3. You need to perform a business impact analysis (BIA) for a set of critical servers as part of a risk management push by your company. Organize the steps of a business impact analysis in their proper order. 
      - The steps are: identify threats, remediate risk, assign risk to each function or asset, identify critical functions or processes, identify assets, and resources.

:warning: **Heads Up**: This section is focused on the CertMaster Practice tool, but students won't get access to this tool until later in the program. For now, point out the high-level features of the tool as explained next:

Explain the following about the CertMaster Practice tool:

- It takes a question-first approach to test preparation. 

  - Questions are organized according to the six different domains that they assess.
  
  - Within each domain, there are subcategories that make up the different topics within the domain. Questions are organized by these subcategories.
  
  - You can start by answering questions within any subcategory. The questions only include multiple-choice questions, not performance-based questions.
  
### 11. Student Do: Security+ Sample Questions (0:15)

Explain that in this section, students will answer practice questions taken from Domain 1 of the Security+ exam.

Point out that the goal is to become familiar with exam questions. Students are not expected to know the answers at this point. They will have plenty of time to learn these topics and practice the questions throughout the course.

Send students the following activity file:

- [Activity File: Security+ Sample Questions](Activities/11_Sec_Questions/Unsolved/Readme.md)


### 12. Instructor Review: Security+ Sample Questions (0:10)

:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 


Use the following solution guide to review the questions and provide extended explanations for each answer. 

Send students the following solution file: 
- [Solution File: Security+ Sample Questions](Activities/11_Sec_Questions/Solved/Readme.md)

### 13. Instructor Do: Challenge Introduction (0:15)

Explain that this week's Challenge has three parts:

1. Students are required to complete prework prior to the program. Students should consider submitting the prework the first part of this week's Challenge.

2. Following our discussion on career roles and pathways, students should write a brief summary of their current skills and what they would like to do after this program. Details are provided in the Challenge file.

3. Most security professionals use prominent reports, blogs, and papers to stay up to date on the field. Since this is such a critical skill, this week's Challenge has students review three prominent security reports in order to get a basic understanding of the market.

This assignment is a bit report-heavy, due to how important both research and reporting are to the work of a cybersecurity professional. Because of this, students will be given a series of worksheets to fill out while navigating the papers. 

If there are questions about due dates, have students consult Canvas.


### 13. Instructor Do: Wrap-Up (0:05) 

If students feel overwhelmed by the amount of information covered, assure them that they will become familiar with these concepts throughout the course. After they receive the CertMaster Practice tool, they will have a full year of access to the platform and can self-study topics at their own pace.

- While we did not do a deep dive into the other domains, emphasize that we will briefly discuss them throughout the modules in this program, and we will help students understand what to study for each. 

Remember to upload the [1.3 Student Guide](StudentGuide.md) and advise students to review it and go over concepts they need more time with. 

Answer any students' questions before ending class. 


### 14. Optional Instructor and TAs Do: Fireside Chat (*If time remains*)

For the remainder of class, spend some time discussing the ways in which you all entered into the industry. Let students ask questions and build up their confidence as best as you can.

- Feel free to adjust the chat as you see fit, but below are some suggested questions:

  - What is your formal title and what do you actually do all day?
  - What were your first cybersecurity jobs?
  - It can be hard to get your first opportunity in the field? How does someone prove that they have the skills and that they know what it takes and have the knowledge? (I.e. web and data science candidates can use portfolios; how do we do that with cyber?)
  - A lot of folks are transitioning into a new field. What advice do you have for people to bridge their past experiences to what they want to do in cybersecurity?
  - What are the most important skills you can learn in your first cybersecurity job?
  - When hiring, what do you look for in candidates?
  - How do you see this space changing in the next 1-3 years? Next 5 years?
