- (2) For the remaining two hours of class, students will conduct their presentations, group by group.

Take a moment to address any questions before proceeding.

### 02. Instructor Do: Final Project Review

Explain to the class that they now have 30 minutes to finalize their project presentations. Remind the class of the following:

- Each group will have a 15-minute time slot for their presentation.
  - Students should plan for a **max** of 12 minutes presenting, followed by 3 minutes of Q&A.
  - Encourage students to practice to make sure that their presentations are no longer than 12 minutes.
  - Note that they don't need to cover every slide in detail during the presentation.

- Groups can choose to have 1 presenter for the whole group, or have the group split up the presentation among group members.
  - **Instructor Note**: For larger class sizes (40+ students), we recommend 1&ndash;2 presenters per group.

- Groups should work together to prepare the presentation, but each student will need to submit a complete presentation as their deliverable (even if it is the same as other group members').

- The framework provided for the presentation should be used for general guidance, but students should feel free to enhance or adjust their presentation as the team sees fit.
  - Students can also elect to share their dashboard or reports during their presentation.

Break students out into their groups, and let the first presentation group know that they will be presenting first in 30 minutes.  

### 03. Student Do: Day 3 Project Presentations

Welcome the students back, and explain that for the remaining class time, students will conduct presentations.Remind the class of the following:
  - They should be aware of their allotted presentation time so that they're ready when their group is called.
  - If time remains in their 15 minutes, they should feel free to take their classmates' questions on their presentation.

Call the first group to present their team project!
