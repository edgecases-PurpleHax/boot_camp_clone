### 01. Instructor Do: Welcome and Day 1 Recap

Welcome students to the second class of the final project week.

Remind students that in the previous class, we emphasized that clear communication of technical topics is a critical skill for cyber professionals.
   
-  Cyber professionals require clear communication for some of the following scenarios:
    - Communicating complex issues to their coworkers and management.
    - Presenting proposals for ordering new technology to management.
    - Explaining their InfoSec/technical experience in job interviews.
    - Presenting cybersecurity research to their peers.
  
Students will get the opportunity to present their own research at our **bootCon** conference in the next class!

Today, we will review some tips for a successful presentation. 


### 02. Instructor Do: bootCon Presentation Tips

Point out that for many people, speaking on a technical topic at a conference such as **bootCon** may seem daunting, especially if you don't have much experience presenting on technical topics. This is completely normal and true even of many cybersecurity professionals!
   - But anyone can give a good presentation with the right preparation. In today's class, we will go through a few tips to help prepare you for a successful **bootCon** presentation in your last class.

**BootCon Presentation Tips**

- **Tip 1 - Assume that your audience is not familiar with technical terms.**
  - Cyber presentations often include technical terminology or devices that the audience may not be familiar with.  
  - Any time you use a technical term or technology, assume that at least some of your audience is not familiar with it.  
  - Always define and explain technical topics or terminologies to your audience.
  - Be prepared for the technical questions that you may receive from audience members who have just learned about a technology.

- **Tip 2 - Minimize text in your slides.**
  - Slides should only contain concise, high-level bullet points about your material. Text on the slides should serve as talking points, not the full presentation.

- **Tip 3 - Tell interesting stories.**
  - Try to include stories to connect with and engage your audience.
  - For example, you might discuss a recent news story that connects to your presentation topic.
  - You could also include personal stories such as what led you to choose this presentation topic, or how many times you failed before succeeding at your goal.
  
- **Tip 4 - Expect the unexpected.**
   - Even the best presenters face many types of unexpected events that can occur during a presentation. For example:
     - The internet isn't accessible.
     - The demonstration doesn't work, or gets an unexpected error.
     - The sound or camera fails.
   - When creating your presentation, prepare for some of these events by doing the following:
     - Have an offline or printed copy of your slides/presentation.
     - If you will conduct a live demonstration, record a video presentation that you could share as a backup.
     - Have a backup laptop or phone available in case your primary device fails.

- **Tip 5 - Provide teachable moments.**
   - Point out aspects of your presentation that can teach the audience useful information.
   - For example, if you illustrated how to create a rogue wireless hotspot, you could teach your audience:
      - The importance of using VPNs to protect their wireless traffic.
      - How to identify trustworthy wireless routers.
   
- **Tip 6 - Practice to yourself, family, and friends, and use their feedback.**
   - Practice, practice, practice!
   - Give your presentation in front of a practice audience (friends or family).
   - Ask for their candid feedback on your speed, clarity, body language, and use of filler words ("uh," "umm," etc.).
      - As a further resource, share the link to the Forbes article [Tips for avoiding using filler words when speaking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2014/12/17/four-ways-to-stop-saying-um-and-other-filler-words/?sh=24fcebee2515) with students.
     
- **Tip 7 - Have fun.**
  - Have fun with your presentation! Not everything technical needs to be boring.
  - Use humor to keep your audience engaged.

- **Tip 8 - Be passionate.**
   - If you're excited and passionate about your topics, you will come across as confident and engaging!

Ask the students if they have any other tips they would like to recommend to their classmates.

Then let students know that for the rest of today's class, they will work on completing their **bootCon** presentations. 

### 03. Instructor Do: Final Class Preview

Remind the class that the next class is the final class of their cohort.

Preview the final class, the **bootCon conference**, by covering the following:
  - We will not have an instructor lecture.
  - We will have a brief introduction, and then proceed with all the class conference presentations.
  - Come to class prepared and ready to present your project!
  - There will be no formal break in the class.
  - The presentation order will be provided by the end of today's class.

Ask the class if they have any questions about the final class before proceeding.

### 04. Student Do: Final Presentation Preparation 

Explain that for the remainder of today's class, students will work on completing their presentations.
- Remind the class of the following:
   - Students are **required** to remain in class (online or in person).
   - If students need any assistance on their presentations, they should reach out to you or the TAs by the end of today's class.

Answer any remaining questions before sending students to work in their groups. Don't forget to share the final presentation order before the end of class.
