# Variable Dissection
In this activity, you'll work with a partner to dissect a python file in trying to determine what will be printed.

## Instructions

1. With a partner, open the Variables-Dissect.py file.

2. Update the code comments to identify the output of each statement
   - Do not run the code at first! See if you can make informed guesses.

3. Once you have filled in all of the comments, run the file and compare the output to your guesses.
   - You may run into some errors trying to run the file! Comment out any disagreeable lines of code.

4. Fix any errors in your guesses, and research why your guesses differed from the result.

Hint: You may want to do some googling to understand some of the operators! Running the code and viewing the output also helps with understanding, so be sure to review after running.
