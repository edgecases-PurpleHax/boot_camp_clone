## 3.3 Lesson Plan: Stick to the Script

### Overview

In today's class, students will further develop their command line skills by learning how to use text processing and text editing to develop their own `cd log_directory` line script.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

- Define three benefits of text processing programs over programming languages for a security professional.

- Use `sed` to make substitutions to a file.

- Use `awk` to isolate data points from a complex log file.

- Edit contents of a file using `nano`.

- Design an IP lookup shell script by passing arguments.

### Instructor Notes

At the end of class today, we will revisit the Using Vagrant Doc from 1.2 to demonstrate pulling the latest virtual machine build. Share the document with students: [Using Vagrant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Grxbagm-2jg22LiatDHzLDpJOsOl5JWJ9gl00TtiX6k/edit?usp=sharing). 

- Emphasize to students that they should be frequently pulling the latest build of their virtual machine as it is being consistently refined and improved. 

- This demonstration was optional in Day 1.2. If you have not demonstrated this yet, you are encouraged to do so in this class. In necessary, use office hours after class to make sure all students know how to run these commands.

### 01. Instructor Do: Class Introduction (0:05)

Begin class by welcoming students back and informing them that today they will learn a powerful skill for IT and security professionals: **command line scripting**.

- Before introducing new command line concepts, we'll review concepts taught in the last class:

  - Command options and man pages.

    - Commands can have their default behavior modified using **options**.

    - Command options can have their own arguments called **parameters**.

    - **Man pages** are documentation that exist within the terminal containing command syntax, options, and parameters.
    
    - `man` followed by a command will display the documentation for that specific command.

  - Searching for directories, files, and data within files.

    - The `find` command is used to find directories or files.
      - `-type d` is the option and parameter for finding directories.
      - `-type f` is the option and parameter for finding a file.

    - The `grep` command is used to find a data point within a file.

    - **Wildcards**, indicated with a `*`, can assist `grep` and `find` by:

        - Searching through multiple files. For example: `*.txt`.
        - Searching for part of a data point. For example: `*login*`.

- Counting data and piping.

  - The `wc` command can be used for counting files, lines, and words.

  - Pipes, which are indicated by `|`, are used to combine multiple commands together.

  - Pipes will take the output from the command on the left and apply it to the the new command on the right.


Remind the class that the best way to learn these commands is to practice them, so we will start today's class with a warm-up activity to practice these commands.

- Ask the class if they have any questions before starting on the warm-up activity.

### 02. Student Do: Warm-Up (0:15)

Explain the following to students:

- In this activity you will continue your role as a security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Thanks to your great work, the authorities have been able to charge Slugworth.

- The prosecutor of the case has subpoenaed you for a list of additional data to help build their case against Slugworth.

- You are tasked with gathering additional information specified in the subpoena.


Send students the following:

- [Activity File: Warm-Up](Activities/02_warmup/unsolved/readme.md)
- [Directories/Files: Warm-Up](Resources/warmup.zip)

Additionally, provide the solution file so the students can self-review:

- [Solution Guide: Warm-Up](Activities/02_warmup/solved/readme.md)


### 03. Instructor Do: Intro to Text Processing (0:10)

Begin by explaining the following challenge commonly faced by security professionals:

 - Security professionals work with many forms of data, such as application logs, server logs, server files, configuration files, and raw code.

 - Many of these forms of data are complex and large, and not easy to analyze in their raw form.

    For example, take a look at the following web server log file:

 ![complexlogs](Images/complexlogs.png)

- These complex data files can be difficult for anyone to analyze.

- Explain that  embedded within these complex and large files are **data points** that can help security analysts research security incidents.  

   - Explain that examples of data points are:
        - Dates
        - Usernames
        - Phone numbers

- Explain that these data points can help security professionals to:

  - **Isolate attack signatures**.

     For example: An attacker could use a specific username to launch an attack. Finding this data point can assist with isolating the username tied to an attacker.

  - **Identify attack vectors**.

     For example: An attacker could launch an attack through a field on a login page. Finding this data point can assist with identifying the field being used for the attack.

  - **Identify timing of attacks**.

    For example: An attacker could launch their attack at exactly midnight every night. Finding this data point can help identify the timing of the attack.


Explain that security professionals are challenged with taking these large and complex files and isolating the data points that are needed to complete their tasks.

- Emphasize that this can be accomplished with text processing commands.

#### Text Processing Commands

Define **text processing commands** as command language used to manipulate text and simplify complex data.

Cover the following:

  - Text processing commands have many capabilities to simplify working with complex data, such as:
    - Substituting text.
    - Filtering lines of text.
    - Delimiting text.

  - There are multiple text processing commands that are already built-in to the terminal, such as `cut`, `awk`, and `sed`.

  Mention that other command languages can also manipulate text, such as Python and C++. These are designed for programming, such as for running web applications.

Explain that text processing provides the following three benefits over programming languages:

 1. **Simplicity**: Text processing is simpler and easier to learn than programming languages.

 2. **Convenience**: Most text processing commands are pre-installed in terminals, unlike many programming languages.

 3. **Compatibility**:  Text processing commands can be easily combined to complete more advanced tasks. This is much more challenging to do with programming languages.

Explain that today we will be focusing on the powerful text processing utilities of `awk` and `sed`.

 - Answer any questions that remain before proceeding to introduce the sed command


### 04. Instructor Do: Intro to sed (0:10)

Begin by reminding the class that we just covered how security professionals spend a lot of time working with complex log files.  

Explain that one source of added time and complication is the need to analyze and consolidate complex data from different sources.

- For example:

     - You need to analyze login activities across two different applications.
     - One application labels logins as LOGGED IN while the other labels them as ACCESS ACCEPTED.

  The challenge is to replace all strings of ACCESS ACCEPTED with LOGGED IN, so the data will be consistent when analyzing the datasets together.


Explain that we can use the text processing command `sed` to accomplish this task.

Introduce `sed` by covering the following:

  - `sed` stands for "stream editor."

  - This means that it reads and edits text, line-by-line, from an input stream.

  - An input stream is a string of all the characters in a text file.

  - Explain that it's a "stream" because `sed` reads the file from top-to-bottom, line-by-line, and only reads each line once.

Summarize that, in layman's terms, `sed` is a command-line utility that modifies text using an easy and compact coding language.

- Explain to the class that, while `sed` has multiple capabilities, we will be learning the most basic `sed` capability: **string replacement**.

#### Using sed for String Replacement

First, explain that string replacement is synonymous with string substitution.

  - Point out that it is similar to the Windows find-and-replace feature.

Inform the class that we will walk through a simple `sed` command to create a basic string replacement.

  - We will be doing the following string replacement:

     `The Dog Chased the Ball` will become ` The Dog Chased the Cat`   

    We will use `sed` to replace `Ball` with `Cat`.    

#### sed Demonstration

1. Access the `/03-instructor/day3/sed_demonstration/` directory:

     `cd /03-instructor/day3/sed_demonstration/`

2. Explain that within this directory, there is a file called: `sed.txt`.

3. Show the contents of the file by running:  

    - `cat sed.txt`

    - Point out that this displays the only line in the file:   

      -  `The Dog Chased the Ball`

4. Point out that next we will use `sed` to replace the word "Ball"  with "Cat" using the following command:

    - `cat sed.txt | sed s/Ball/Cat/`

     Explain the syntax:

    -   `cat  (file name)   (pipe)    sed   s/(old value)/(replacement value)/`

5. Run the command and point out it replaces the word  "Ball" with "Cat" with the following result:

   - `The Dog Chased the Cat`


#### Demo Summary

Review the following concepts:

  - `sed` is a text processing utility that can assist security professionals with analyzing data.

  - The most basic `sed` capability is string replacement. This can increase consistency across separate data sources, which can assist in research.

  - The basic syntax of string replacement is `sed   s/(old value)/(replacement value)/`.

Take a moment to address questions before proceeding.

Explain that in the next command line activity, students will get to use the `sed` command to replace data in a log file to make data consistent.

### 05. Student Do: Using sed (0:15)

Explain the following to students:

- In this activity you will continue your role as a security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Your manager believes there is a new cybercriminal attempting, but failing, to log in to several administrative websites owned by Wonka.

- Your manager has provided you with the access logs for two different administrative websites. They want to find out information about this cybercriminal before they get unauthorized access.

- You are first tasked with combining the two different access logs into a single file and using text processing to make the "failed login" data consistent.

Send students the following:

- [Activity File: Using sed](Activities/06_sed_activity/unsolved/readme.md)
- [Directories/Files: Using sed](Resources/learning_sed.zip)

### 06. Instructor Review: Using sed Activity (0:05)
:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 



Remind students that the goal of this activity was to practice using the text processing capability of `sed` to replace data and make data consistent.

Explain that this activity required the following steps:

  - Concatenating multiple files into a single file.
  - Using  `sed` to do a replacement of text.
  - Redirecting the results into a new file.

Send students the following solution file and use it to guide your review:

- [Solution Guide: Using sed ](Activities/06_sed_activity/solved/readme.md)

 Answer any questions that remain before proceeding to the next lesson.

### 07. Instructor Do: Intro to awk (0:15)

Begin this section by reminding students that security professionals often need to obtain specific data points within complex log files.

- For example:

  - You have a log file that contains city, state, and country fields, separated out by commas. However, for our analysis, we only need the states from the log file.

  - In other words, our log record contains records like "Atlanta, Georgia, USA," but we only need "Georgia."

- Explain that we can technically use `sed` to perform the task with the following command:

   -  `sed 's/^.*\(,.*,\).*$/\1/' | sed 's/,//g'`

- But while `sed` can technically perform this task, it is a complicated set of code that takes time to compose.  

- Fortunately, there is another text processing utility called `awk` that will allow us to perform this task more efficiently.

Introduce `awk` by covering the following:

 - Like `sed`, `awk` is designed for text processing, but is primarily used for data extraction and reporting from streams of text.

 - `awk` can separate out fields in a stream of text and isolate specific fields needed.

Explain that we will demonstrate how to isolate the State field from the above example by using `awk`.

#### awk Demonstration


1. Access the `/03-instructor/day3/awk_demonstration/` directory:

    `cd /03-instructor/day3/awk_demonstration/`

2. Within this directory is a file called: `awk.txt`.

3. Show the contents of the file by running:  

    - `cat awk.txt`

   Point out that this displays the only line in the file:   

      - `Atlanta, Georgia, USA`

4. Explain that to use `awk` to only display the state, Georgia, we will run the following:        

    - `awk -F, '{print $2}' awk.txt`

    Break down the above syntax of the `awk` command (everything after the pipe):

    - `awk -F(delimiter)  '{print $(field_number)}' `  

      - `awk`: Indicator telling your operating system to run the `awk` command.

      - `-F,`: Option for doing field separation with `awk`.

        - The value that comes right after `F` is the parameter signifying how the file separates out the data points. In the example, the parameter is a comma (`,`).

        - This parameter is also known as the **delimiter**.

        - **Note**: The parameter needs to come directly after the `-F`, with no spaces.

    - `'{print  $2}'`

      - This indicates `awk` is printing the second field, after the fields have been separated by a comma.

      - The `$` is included before the number to indicate the field.  

      - Multiple fields can be added, with a comma between each.

      - The required format must have single quotes (`''`) and curly brackets (`{}`) around the print function.

5. Run the command and point out the following:

    - We were able to separate out `Atlanta, Georgia, USA` by commas using `awk` and only print out the second field, which contained the value `Georgia`.

    - This is a much simpler set of code then what was required by `sed`.


:bar_chart: Take a moment to run a comprehension check poll and address any questions before moving on. 

- Point out that this was a very basic example, and often security professionals need to isolate out multiple fields from complex log files.

- Explain that we will do another more challenging demonstration to illustrate how `awk` can be used to assist with a security incident.

#### awk Demonstration for a Security Incident

- Explain the following scenario to the class:

    - You are security analysts at ACME Corp, which has just experienced an attack of a high volume of network requests.

    - You have been provided the logs of these network requests.

    - You are tasked with isolating out the IP addresses and times from these logs to determine which IP address is appearing most frequently. This IP likely belongs to the attacker.

1. Access the `/03-instructor/day3/awk_demonstration/` directory. Run:

    - `cd /03-instructor/day3/awk_demonstration/`

2. Preview the log file, called `access_logs`. Run:

    - `more access_logs`


3. Explain that next, we need to analyze the data of the log file to determine how to build our `awk` command.

    Note each of the items below:

    - The fields are separated out by spaces, so a space will be used as a field separator.

    - When we separate out the fields by spaces, Time is in the second field, so we will need to print out the second field first.

    - IP addresses are in the first field, so we will need to print this field out after time.

4. Type the following `awk` command to illustrate how this will be accomplished:

      - `awk -F" "  '{print $2, $1}' access_logs`

     Explain the syntax of the `awk` command (after the pipe):

     - `awk -F" "`

        - This is instructing the operating system to run the `awk` command of field separation.

        - In this example, one space is the delimiter.

          To indicate that want to separate the fields by spaces, we place once space between two double quotes.


      - `{print $2, $1}`

          - This command will print out the second and first fields, in that order.  

6. Run the command and point out that `awk` is able to take a complex log file, and parse it out to show only the fields needed: Time and IP Address.

7. Explain that in this result, the top reoccurring IP of  `41.33.233.87`  is easy to detect. This is likely IP address of the attacker.

8. Explain that identifying an IP address of the attacker can assist a security professional with determining what IP address should be blocked from a network to prevent future attacks.


 #### awk Summary  

 Review the following concepts:

  - `awk` is a text processing utility like `sed`, but is more robust, as it can separate out fields with simple code.

  - `awk` can assist security professionals by isolating specific data points, like IP addresses, to assist with determining what IP addresses should be blocked.

  - The basic syntax of field separation with `awk` is:

     - `awk -F(delimiter)  '{print $(field_number)}' `  

Take a moment to address questions before proceeding.

Explain that in the next command line activity, students will get to use the `awk` command to  isolate out certain fields on a log file.

### 08.  Student Do: Using awk (0:15)

Explain the following to students:

- You will continue your role as a security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Your manager needs your assistance finding information on the cybercriminal who is attempting to log in to several administrative websites owned by Wonka.

- You are now tasked with isolating several fields from the log file to determine the primary username attempting to log in to the administrative websites.

Send students the following instructions:

### 09. Instructor Review: Using awk (0:05)
:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 

Remind students that the goal of this activity is to practice using the  `awk` command, and to see how it can be used to isolate certain fields from complex files.


Explain that this activity required the following steps:

  - Moving a file.
  - Using `awk` to isolate out certain fields.
  - Redirecting the results into a new file.

Send students the following solution file and use it to guide your review:

- [Solution Guide: Using awk](Activities/09_awk_activity/solved/readme.md)


Answer any questions that remain before taking a break.


### 10. Break (0:15)



### 11. Instructor Do: Intro to Shell Scripting (0:08)


Welcome class back from break and remind them that this week, they have learned many commands to complete a variety of IT and security tasks from the command line.

- Explain that as IT and security professionals, they will be required to complete security tasks that involve multiple subsequent commands.

  - For example: An IT professional could be tasked with cleaning up space in a directory because log files are taking up too much space.

  - To complete these tasks they would need to run the following  three separate commands, in order:
    1. `cd` to navigate to the directory containing log files.

    2. `zip` to compress the files.

        - `zip` commands will be explained in more detail in a future lesson.

    3. `mv` to move the new zip file into an archive folder.


Rather than run each of these activities separately, we can **script** them together, which allows the commands to be run in order using a single command.

Explain that writing scripts, or **scripting**,  provides the following benefits to IT and security professionals:

   - Running multiple commands with a single script can improve the speed of accomplishing tasks.

   - Having a single script that runs multiple commands can improve the consistency of task results.

   - Scripts can be provided to other users for reusability, meaning the exact same tasks can be completed by someone unfamiliar with the individual commands necessary to complete them.

Explain that in the terminal, we will focus on a specific type of scripting known as  **shell scripting**.

  - **Shell** is a terminal program that assists in the interaction between the user and the terminal.

     - There are many shells available in the terminal, such as `sh`, `bash`, `zsh`, and `csh`.

  - Shell scripting is a way of using these shell programs to automate tasks in the form of a collection of commands.

Explain how shell scripts are designed by illustrating the following:

   - For the above example, we could write a single shell script called `diskcleanup.sh`.

   - Within the `diskcleanup.sh` are the three commands in the order they need to run, from top down, one line per command:

      - `cd log_directory`
      - `zip logfiles.zip Log*.txt`
      - `mv logfiles.zip ./archive_directory`

   - To execute the shell script, we'd only need to run this single command:

      - `sh diskcleanup.sh`

   - Running that single command would execute all three commands inside of the script, in order.


Explain that before we start writing our own scripts, we need to learn how to write into a file to add in our commands.   


### 12. Instructor Do: Writing and Editing Files (0:15)

Explain that text editors are efficient utilities for creating and editing files containing data.

#### Text Editors

Introduce text editors by covering the following:

- **Text editors** can be run from the terminal or desktop environments, depending on the editor.

- IT and security professionals can use text editors to build scripts and create documentation, reports, or files of any type.

- Students are likely familiar with a type of text editor: Notepad in Windows.

- Common text editors available within the terminal are Nano, vi, Vim, and Emacs.

- Text editors can be used to create new files or edit existing files.

Explain that we will be completing a file editing demonstration with the text editor **Nano**, as this is the simplest one to learn and typically available on most terminals

Explain that we will use Nano to create a simple shell script that contains the two following commands:

   - `mkdir new_directory`
   - `cd new_directory`


#### Building a Shell Script Demonstration

1. Navigate to `/03-instructor/day3/`

2.  Create a `nano_demonstration` directory:

    - `mkdir nano_demonstration`

3. Access the `/03-instructor/day3/nano_demonstration/` directory:

    - `cd nano_demonstration`

4. Explain that to create a new script called `myfirstscript.sh` with Nano, we would run:

    - `nano myfirstscript.sh`

   The syntax is simply:

     - `nano <new file name>`

5.  Point out that if the file already existed, it would take you to edit that previously existing file.

6.  Run the command: `nano myfirstscript.sh` and point out that this takes you into an editing window within the terminal.

    ![screenshot](Images/nano_screenshot.png)

7.  Explain that to start off, we'll need to add:

      - `#!/bin/bash`
    
    Remind students that the line `#!/bin/bash` this tells our Linux OS that this is a bash script, and should be run with the bash shell. This will also create a log in the `/bin/bash` directory, which is important so that we may see when different scripts were run. 

8.  Next we'll type the first command on the first line:

      - `mkdir scripts`

9. Enter the second command on the second line:

      - `mv myfirstscript.sh scripts`

10.  Explain that next, we need to save the changes in this file:

      - Hold the Ctrl key and x at the same time.
      - You will be asked if you want to save the file. Press Y for yes. 

11.  Point out that it will confirm the name of the file:  `myfirstscript.sh`

      - Press Enter to keep this file name.

12.  Explain that this just created a shell script file called `myfirstscript.sh`.

13.  Illustrate that to run this new shell script we would simply run:

      - `sh myfirstscript.sh`

14. Run the command and explain that this just made a directory, called `scripts` and placed your script file into it.

15. Run the `ls scripts` command to show that this took place.


 #### File Writing and Editing Summary  

 Review the following concepts:

  - Text editors are command line utilities that are used to create or edit plain text files.

  -  Nano is an easy-to-use text editor that is available in most terminals, and is good for creating shell scripts.

Take a moment to address questions before proceeding.

Explain that in the next command line activity, students will get to use the `nano` command to do write their first shell script.


### 13. Student Do: My First Shell Script (0:15)


Explain the following to students:

- In this activity you will continue your role as a security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Your manager needs your assistance creating a simple shell script to automate the `awk` and `sed` tasks you did today on your log file.

- This shell script can be provided to other security analysts so they can easily complete the same tasks you ran today.

- You are tasked with using `nano` to create a shell script with the `awk` and `sed` commands to analyze a log file.

Send students the following:

- [Activity File: My First Shell Script](Activities/14_shell_scripting/unsolved/readme.md)
- [Directories/Files: My First Shell Script](Resources/first_shell_script.zip)


### 14. Instructor Review: My First Shell Script Activity (0:07)
:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 

Remind students that the point of this exercise is to learn how using shell scripts can assist with executing several commands by running one single command.


Explain that this activity required the following steps:

  - Use `nano` to create a shell script.
  - Place the `sed` and `awk` commands inside the shell script.
  - Execute the shell script to confirm the results are as expected.

Send students the following solution file and use it to guide your review:

- [Solution Guide: My First Shell Script](Activities/14_shell_scripting/solved/readme.md)


Congratulate the students for building their very first shell script!

 Explain that in the final terminal activity of the week, students will be using many of the skills they learned this week to build  a shell script that can look up the country of an IP address.


### 15. Instructor Do: Passing Arguments (0:07)

Explain to the class that the script they just created will run the exact same process each time it is executed.

However, there may be times when they'll need to change a single value in a script.

- For example: A security analyst may need to run the cleanup shell script we just created, but only need it to zip up a certain file date.

  - If we need to zip up files named `logs0519`, we need to change one command in the script:

    -  `zip logs* logfiles.zip` > `zip logs0519 logfiles.zip`   

  - Rather than  manually edit the script to make this change each time the script is run, we can add a **passing argument**.

#### Passing a Single Argument

Explain how to pass a single argument in a shell script by covering the following:

  - You pass an argument into a script simply by placing the argument after the script name.

    - For the above example, we can run:

      -  `sh diskcleanup.sh  0519`

     - The syntax is: `sh   (shell script name) (Argument1)`

  - Explain that to pass the `0519` into the script, we have to add a `$1` indicating where the first argument, `0519`, will be passed.

      - We would change:

          `zip logs* logfiles.zip`

         to

        `zip logs$1 logfiles.zip`  
      - This way, when the script `sh diskcleanup.sh  0519` is run, the command will be changed to:

        - `zip logs0519 logfiles.zip`

#### Adding Multiple Arguments   

  - Explain that additional arguments can be added with the following syntax:

      - `sh   shellscript   Argument1 Argument2 Argument3`

- For example:

    - `sh diskcleanup.sh  0519  backupfolder`

  - Within the script, the arguments would be represented by:   
       - Argument1 = `$1`
       - Argument2 = `$2`
       - Argument3 = `$3`

 #### Passing Arguments Summary  

 Review the following concepts:

  - Some scripts have to be slightly modified each time they are run. This can be simplified by passing arguments.

  - When a script is run, you can add an argument or multiple arguments to pass into a script simply by placing the argument(s) after the script name.

  - Within the script itself, an argument or arguments can be represented by a `$1` for the first argument, `$2` for the second argument, and so on.

Take a moment to address questions before proceeding.

Explain that in the final command line activity, students will get to use all the skills learned today to build their own IP lookup script.


### 16. Student Do: Building an IP Lookup Tool (0:15)


Explain the following to students:

- In this activity you will continue your role as a security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Your manager needs to know which country these attacks are coming from so they can block it from accessing their network.

- You manager is impressed with the great work you did on the last script and  would like you to design one that can look up the the country from an IP address in the logs.

Send students the following instructions:

### 17. Instructor Review: Building an IP Lookup Tool Activity (0:05)
:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 

Remind students that the goal of this activity was to review many of the command line skills covered during the week.  Additionally, let students know that looking up a location associated with an IP is a common security task.


Explain that this activity required the following steps:

  - Using `man` to learn a new command.
  - Using `grep`, pipes, and `awk` to filter results from a command.
  - Designing a shell script to include the modified command.
  - Configuring the shell script to accept arguments.
  - Running the shell script by passing arguments.

Send students the following solution file and use it to guide your review:

- [Solution Guide: Building an IP Lookup Tool](Activities/17_ip_lookup_activity/solved/readme.md)


Ask the class if they have any questions before moving onto the weekly recap.

### 18. Optional Instructor Do: Weekly Recap and Vagrant Updates Demo (0:00)

Explain to students that they'll be using their Vagrant lab extensively for a large portion of the boot camp. Documentation for Vagrant use has been created for students.

- Share the following link with students: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Grxbagm-2jg22LiatDHzLDpJOsOl5JWJ9gl00TtiX6k/edit?usp=sharing

#### Finding and Updating Vagrant Machines 

Explain that we are going to cover how to manage the boot camp's virtual environment using Vagrant. We're covering these commands at the end of the week's classes because the Challenge requires no dependencies from this week.

Explain that Vagrant uses Vagrant box files as a base to create VirtualBox virtual machines. We're going to move through the steps below to ensure our Vagrant box files and VirtualBox VMs are updated.

Explain that in order to make sure they are using the latest machines, we'll do the following steps in the terminal:
1. Find all Vagrant machine installations.
2. Navigate to one of the Vagrant machine locations.
3. Update the Vagrant box that's used to create the VirtualBox VM.
4. Destroy the old, outdated VirtualBox VM.
5. Bring up the updated VirtualBox VM.
6. Discard old, unused versions of Vagrant boxes.

- Have everyone open their Git Bash or Mac Terminal.

Explain that we're going to use the command `vagrant global-status --prune` to see where we have Vagrant machines installed in order to update them properly.

- Have everyone run `vagrant global-status --prune` and point out the `directory` column of the ouput:

  ```
  id       name    provider   state    directory                                  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  f99ec56  default virtualbox poweroff C:/Users/student/Documents/Cybersecurity-Bootcamp/Linux-Module

  The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
  on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
  up-to-date (use "vagrant global-status --prune" to prune invalid
  entries). To interact with any of the machines, you can go to that
  directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly with
  Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
  "vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
  ```

Explain that we'll want to navigate to the directory where we have the `Linux-Module` installed to update the machine. Have everyone run:

- `cd $HOME/Documents/Cybersecurity-Bootcamp/Linux-Module`

Explain that this directory has the virtual machine definitions for the Ubuntu machine that we'll be using in upcoming lessons. It should be updated at the end of every week in case there are critical virtual machine-specific issues. We can download updates with the command `vagrant box update`.

:warning: **Heads Up**: The following updating step may take a long time depending on your and students' bandwidth. If that is the case, it may be better to cancel the process (Ctrl+C) and simply demonstrate the remaining steps.

- Have everyone run `vagrant box update` and explain that we may see output telling us what version we are on. (The version will be different than below.):

  ```console
  $ vagrant box update
  ==> default: Checking for updates to 'cybersecurity/UbuntuVM'
      default: Latest installed version: 1.1.1
      default: Version constraints:
      default: Provider: virtualbox
  ==> default: Updating 'cybersecurity/UbuntuVM' with provider 'virtualbox' from version
  ==> default: '1.1.1' to '1.1.2'...
  ==> default: Loading metadata for box 'https://vagrantcloud.com/cybersecurity/UbuntuVM?access_token=QzFrkLuXSrDBgA.atlasv1.22jkxzzRPPhfg1jmWDfaTmr5KFywkVXT7sKowBPfGkbAVyQIuQDiKsgUZHdmeNDzBbQ'
  ==> default: Adding box 'cybersecurity/UbuntuVM' (v1.1.2) for provider: virtualbox
      default: Downloading: https://vagrantcloud.com/cybersecurity/boxes/UbuntuVM/versions/1.1.2/providers/virtualbox.box
      default: Download redirected to host: vagrantcloud-files-production.s3.amazonaws.com
      default:
  ==> default: Successfully added box 'cybersecurity/UbuntuVM' (v1.1.2) for 'virtualbox'!
  ```

- Note that this only locally loads the base Vagrant box that will be used to create our VirtualBox VM. The machines themselves are not updated yet. 

- In order to update the virtual machines, we need to run `vagrant destroy` to remove the old virtual machine, and then `vagrant up` to create a new virtual machine using the updated Vagrant box.

  - :warning: **Heads Up**: Even if there isn't an update to the machine, it is important to have students practice running the steps to update their own Vagrant machine so that they can keep their virtual machines updated outside of class.

- Demonstrate or have everyone run `vagrant destroy`. Note that many students may still be downloading the newer boxes. 
  - Explain that this process will shut down the machine if it's running, and then ask if you want to remove the machine. Enter Y to accept.

- After Vagrant is done removing the virtual machine, you'll notice that it no longer shows up in the VirtualBox GUI. We'll now use `vagrant up` to load the new VirtualBox VM using the newly downloaded Vagrant box.

After the virtual machine is started up, we can optionally delete any old virtual machines with `vagrant box prune`.

- Demonstrate or have everyone run `vagrant box prune` and explain that this process removes any unused virtual machines.

Summarize that at the end of each week, or if students encounter machine-breaking issues, they should do the following to make sure their Vagrant lab environment is updated:

1. Run `vagrant global-status --prune` to find the locations of all Vagrant machines.

2. Navigate to the directory where the machine is installed with `cd $HOME/Documents/Cybersecurity-Bootcamp/Linux-Module` (this directory may be different depending on your class's setup).
3. Check for machine updates with `vagrant box update`.
4. Shut down the current VM, if it's running, with `vagrant destroy`.
5. Load the new virtual machines with `vagrant up`.
6. Optionally, remove outdated Vagrant base boxes with `vagrant box prune`.

To run all of the Vagrant commands in sequence, run: 
- `vagrant box update && vagrant destroy --force && vagrant up && vagrant box prune` 
  - (`vagrant destroy --force` skips the prompt).

Spend the remaining class time reviewing any questions students have regarding material from today and the week.
