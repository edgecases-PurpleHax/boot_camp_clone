## 2.2 Lesson Plan: Risk Management and Threat Modeling

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to **cyber risk management** and **threat modeling**.

### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

- Identify threat agents, possible attacks, and exploitable vulnerabilities relevant to a given asset.

- Prioritize risks based on likelihood and impact potential.

- Choose and justify controls for a given risk.

### Instructor Notes

Today's lesson will use the **OWASP Threat Modelling** protocol and its subsequent steps in order to approach  cyber risk management and threat modeling.

- We will use a macro-enabled, risk analysis spreadsheet that includes a heat map: [Risk Analysis Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gwNSDxTnVOv7d8PXXZCjZl00ymtKwQjkWCKD1IaMC-A/edit#gid=1384626883)

- Editing access is not available for this document. In order to work in this file, you and students will need to make a copy by navigating to **File** > **Make a copy...**

- When creating the heat map, only add probability and impact values of 10, 20, 30 or 40.  Otherwise, the heat map will malfunction.

### 01. Instructor Do: Welcome and Overview (0:05)

This section will serve as a brief review of the topics and scenario of last class, and a broad introduction to threat modeling and risk management.

- Welcome students to class and briefly review topics covered in the previous class:

  - The roles and responsibilities of the **Security Department**.

  - Applying the **security culture framework** to build a plan for improving an organization's security culture.

  - Identifying appropriate security controls for a given resource and situation.

Inform students that we will continue our GeldCorp scenario from last class. GeldCorp is a financial technology firm experiencing a physical breach. As a hired consultant, the student developed a security awareness training plan for their employees.

- Point out that this incident suggests GeldCorp might be facing other serious risks, which they should address before they get exploited again.

Today's class will introduce **risk management** and **threat modeling** as methods of identifying, anticipating, budgeting, and planning for when risks occur.

- These tools will allow students to:

  - Enumerate possible risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to a company.

  - Identify the most likely and most serious risks.

  - Evaluate the impact the occurrence of a serious risk may have.

  - Develop strategies for monitoring or mitigating.

- Emphasize that these skills will augment students' knowledge of technical infrastructure protection, with an emphasis on evaluating _what_ to protect.

- Present the daily objectives, and take a moment to address remaining questions before proceeding.

### 02. Instructor Do: Introduction to Threat Modeling and Risk Management (0:20)

#### Risk Management and Threat Modeling

Explain that we will review the basic security elements of vulnerabilities, threats, and risks, and how they apply to the practical business tasks of risk analysis, risk management, and threat modeling.  

- Review the definitions of the terms vulnerability, threat, and risk:

  - A **vulnerability** is the aspect of a business that can be exploited to compromise a system's CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability).

  - A **threat** is an actor that might exploit a vulnerability. Threats can be intentional (a malicious hacker steals data), unintentional (an incompetent sysadmin destroys the network), or due to a natural disaster.

  - A **risk** is the possibility of losing something valuable. Equivalently, a risk will cost money if it occurs.

Now, explain the common business practices that organizations employ to understand, manage, and forecast these elements:  

- Define **risk analysis** as the practice of understanding what risks an organization faces, which are most severe, and which are most likely.

- Define **risk management** as the practice of using the results of such an analysis to determine how to deploy personnel and spend budget.

- Define **threat modeling** as the practice of determining which attacks an organization is most likely to experience,  who is most likely to launch them, and what can be done to stop them.

Emphasize that these practices directly relate to a business's pursuit of profit:

  - Risk analysis is important because it quantifies how much a business needs to spend in the event of a given security breach. Therefore, businesses can plan for setbacks before they occur.

  - Threat modeling is important because risks come with a price, which the business will have to pay if the threat is realized. Threat modeling allows them to prioritize the most expensive risks. 

Explain that threat modeling is so essential to the running of a business that the results of threat modeling are funneled upwards to executives to influence business decisions.

We'll continue the lesson focusing on how to perform threat modeling.

#### Threat Modeling Methodologies

Explain that there are multiple approaches to threat modeling. Security professionals often refer to the following industry standard frameworks for the general steps of the process:

  - **PASTA**: Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis. It aims to align consideration of business objectives with technical requirements.

  - **STRIDE**: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, DoS (Denial of Service), Elevation of Privilege. It focuses on identifying what can fail in the system being modeled.

  - **OWASP**: Open Web Application Security Project. It focuses on identifying possible threats, prioritizing risks, and planning mitigation strategies. It is mainly applied to the analysis of applications, such as web or desktop apps.

Explain that each methodology is relevant in different situations. A bank might opt for PASTA, which gives greater consideration to the business being modeled, while a pen testing firm would probably opt to use STRIDE or OWASP. Students should know that they are likely to run into more than one of these during their professional careers.

Explain that for this lesson, we will focus on the OWASP Threat Modeling process for the rest of the lesson.

#### OWASP In-Depth

Explain that the OWASP process consists of six steps: 
1. Determine Assessment Scope
2. Identify Threat Agents
3. Identify Possible Attacks
4. Identify Exploitable Vulnerabilities
5. Rank/Prioritize Risks
6. Mitigate Risks


Provide a brief overview of each step:

1. **Determine Assessment Scope**: Listing the assets under consideration, determining their value, and defining objectives for your threat modeling assessment.
    
    - **Asset value** is the monetary worth of a given asset. For assets like web applications, asset value should represent how much revenue and profit the asset generates.

    - An **objective** is the metric that the business wants to achieve, such as reducing the incidence of DoS attacks against its servers. 
  
2. **Identify Threat Agents**: A **threat agent** is a person or group that can actualize a threat, whether or not they are malicious. 
  
    - Examples include APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats), script kiddies, employees who open phishing emails, and even incompetent users who break configurations on company computers.

3. **Identify Possible Attacks**: Identify the attacks that each threat agent is likely to perform, based on how much skill and funding they have. 
  
4. **Identify Exploitable Vulnerabilities**: Identify ways for data to enter and exit the system. 
  
   - For example, a web application takes information in from users and sends information back out in response to requests. Consider ways attackers might exploit these points of entry and exit.
  
5. **Rank/Prioritize Risks**: Rank which potential attacks are most severe and most likely to occur.
  
6. **Mitigate Risks**: Determine ways to mitigate the most serious risks you identified.


Inform students that they will have an opportunity to practice each of these six steps throughout today's exercises.

We will now proceed by discussing the first four steps in more detail.

#### Step 1: Determining Scope

Explain that determining scope aims to identify which assets an organization wants to assess. 
  
- Organizations often consider one specific category of risk at a time. 

- For example, they might perform a risk analysis to specifically assess the weakness of their network infrastructure, and _not_ think about their application security. 

- When an organization focuses on specific subset of their assets, they are adjusting their scope.

- Scope is important because it tells risk analysts what they should focus on and what they can ignore.

Scoping begins with **asset inventory**. 
  
- Asset inventory is the process of identifying and assigning an asset value (financial worth of an asset) to all of an organization's assets. 

- For assets like a web application, asset value might be measured as revenue and/or profit it generates. A secret recipe might be valued as the amount of revenue generated by that particular dish, plus however much the business gains by being the only one to offer it.

- Determining scope usually results in a spreadsheet or a written report.

Explain that today's exercise scenario will focus on analyzing GeldCorp's internal corporate and web application networks. The assets that students will focus on are their servers and databases.

- Inform students that the activity does not require them to go through the scoping step themselves. They have already been provided a description of GeldCorp's networks.

#### Step 2: Identifying Threat Agents

Explain that analysts identify threat agents by determining which attackers would be interested in the relevant assets. Analysts also consider "unwitting" sources of threats, such as incompetent employees and natural disasters. However, these unintentional threat agents will not be the focus of today's discussion.

  - For example: Threat agents faced by Facebook are script kiddies, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and disgruntled insiders.

#### Step 3: Identifying Potential Attacks

Explain that analysts identify which attacks the threat agent would most likely perform.

  - For example: A script kiddie would have different goals than a disgruntled employee. Therefore, they would use different attacks. As such, these are different risks and must be considered separately.

Analysts often consider each threat agent's motivation, skill level, and level of funding when determining which attacks they will attempt.

  - For example: Suppose a client's web application is taken offline by a DoS attack. The severity of this risk depends on the threat agent:
  
    - A script kiddie might DoS a server simply to cause trouble.
  
  - An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), on the other hand, might DoS a server as a smokescreen while they break in elsewhere to steal trade secrets.


#### Step 4: Identifying Exploitable Vulnerabilities and Points of Failure

Finally, analysts evaluate the system for ways malicious attackers can deliver these attacks and which parts of the system are likely to suffer security failures.

  - For example: If your network uses one database to store all data, the entire company will lose access to all data if that single machine goes down. An attacker seeking to DoS the company's network can exploit this database to achieve their goal.

#### Summary

Review the steps of the OWASP threat modeling process and their corresponding action items:

  - **Determining Assessment Scope**: Identify all relevant assets and their financial values.

  - **Identify Threat Agents**: Identify potential attackers who might be interested in these assets and possible unwitting sources of risk.

  - **Identify Potential Attacks**: Identify attacks that these threat agents are most likely to use.

  - **Identify Exploitable Vulnerabilities**: Identify areas in the system most vulnerable to these kinds of attacks.

Inform students that they'll have an opportunity to practice applying these four steps in the next exercise.

Take a moment to address questions before proceeding.

### 03. Student Do: Threat Modeling Steps 1-4 (0:25)

In this activity, students will learn more about GeldCorp's business operations and assets, and then apply steps 1-4 of the OWASP Threat Modeling Process.

Explain the following:

- You will play the role of security consultants contracted to advise a financial technology firm called GeldCorp.

-  Because of a major breach that the finance department experienced, your assignment to help better understand where its core networks are most vulnerable to attack and advise them of what is most important to protect.

- In this specific activity,  you’ll read about the business and its assets, then apply Steps 1-4 of the OWASP Threat Modeling Process

:globe_with_meridians: This activity will use breakout rooms. Assign students into groups of 2-4 and move them into breakout rooms. 

Send students the following file: 
- [Activity File: Threat Modeling Steps 1-4](Activities/03_Threat_Modeling/Unsolved/README.md)


### 04. Instructor Review: Threat Modeling Steps 1-4 Activity (0:10)

:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 

This activity had students apply the first four steps of the threat modeling process to a business scenario.

Distribute the solution file and use it to review:

- [Solution Guide: Threat Modeling Steps 1-4](Activities/03_Threat_Modeling/Solved/README.md)

Note that not all students will be familiar with the possible attack and exploitable vulnerabilities listed in the solution file.

- At this point in the program, there is no need to go in depth into the nuances of these attacks (as students will learn more about them in future modules).

- Instead, keep the discussion high level and focus on students' critical thinking abilities.

#### Walkthrough

- **Step 1**: Determine Assessment Scope

    - We completed Step 1 by reading the provided information and familiarized ourselves with the assessment scope.  

- **Step 2:** List three threat agents relevant to the intranet.

    - Script kiddies

    - Organized cybercriminals

    - Insider threats

- **Step 3:** List three potential attacks against the intranet.

    - **Phishing**: An attacker might try to gain access to the private intranet by phishing employees.

    - **Malware**: Attackers might use malware to infect the intranet. For example, they may infect it with ransomware.

    - **Physical attacks**:  Attackers might be able to gain physical access to the building.

- **Step 4:** Identify three possible vulnerabilities in the intranet, and rank them in order of severity. Explain how each one could be exploited.

    - **No content filter**: Employees can download files from any site they want. This makes it much easier for attackers to introduce malware.

    - **Poor access control policies**: Every employee in a department should not have access to all of that department's data.

    - **Older workstations**: Windows 7/8 machines are more vulnerable than newer versions.

### Bonus: Web Application Infrastructure 

- List three threat agents relevant to the web application:

    - **Script kiddies** are a risk to any website. They are unsophisticated and don't have a lot of money, so they're fairly harmless, unless there are easily exploitable vulnerabilities in the client-side web application.

    - **Organized cybercriminals** might specifically target GeldCorp because they manage money and equity transfers. These attackers are well-motivated and skilled enough to identify and exploit subtle security holes.

    - **Insider threats** are worth considering. Recall that all employees in a given department can access all of that department's data. This means that an engineer on the front-end web team would be able to read the code behind the automated trading algorithms, which the company considers top secret. This is a problem, because that engineer can now leak those secrets, even though he didn't need access to them in the first place.

- List three attacks that threat agents might attempt against the web application. Explain what the attacker gains from the attack.

    - **DDoS**: The trading platform must respond to the market in real time. Taking down the web application through a DDoS attack would have serious impact on the business's reputation. This is most likely to come from script kiddies.

    - **Dumping the database**: Attackers might attempt to use SQL injection to dump the database to steal social security numbers. Script kiddies and more sophisticated attackers might both try this attack.

    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: With cross site scripting, an attacker can execute malicious code into a vulnerable web page.  Depending on the code,  attackers can execute a number of attacks, including the transmission of sensitive data such as cookies and session information, redirecting the victim to malicious web content, or compromising the victim’s machine.

- Identify three possible vulnerabilities in the web application infrastructure, and rank them in order of severity. Explain how each one could be exploited.

    - The **app server** is probably vulnerable to XSS vulnerabilities. These can be used to steal user cookies and hijack their sessions.

    - The **database** is probably vulnerable to SQL injection. This could be exploited to dump confidential PII.

        - GeldCorp did not state that the database was encrypted. If attackers dump the database, they'll immediately have access to confidential PII in plaintext.


### 05. Instructor Do: Risk Analysis (0:30)

:warning: **Heads Up**: This section covers math formulas. Be prepared to allocate a little extra time answering questions during this section.

Explain that in this section, we will focus on risk analysis and explain the process of prioritizing attack possibilities.

Point out that some of the possible threat agents and attacks that students identified in the previous exercise are more likely than others. The goal of these first four steps was to identify all possible threats, including unlikely ones.

  - For example: script kiddies are likely to account for the majority of attacks an organization experiences, simply because they're so numerous.

  - For most organizations, organized cybercriminals aren't a major threat actor. They are more relevant to financial organizations, branches of government, and military targets.

- Explain that **risk analysis** is the process of prioritizing these possibilities according to their potential impact and likelihood.

Provide the following scenario to contextualize risk analysis:

  - You've identified over 10 potential attacks that GeldCorp should consider. All can be mitigated, but it costs upwards of $2.5k to implement each fix. Their Security Department only has $10k budgeted for this project, and needs advice on which four fixes would have the greatest security benefit.

Let students know that we'll proceed by exploring:

  - Qualitative vs. Quantitative Risk Analysis

  - Likelihood, Impact, and Loss Expectancies

  - Risk Factor and Heat Maps

#### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Risk Analysis

Explain that risk analysis can be conducted in one of two ways: qualitatively or quantitatively.

- Define **qualitative risk analysis** as the process of prioritizing risk based on intangible factors.

- Define **quantitative risk analysis** as the process of evaluating each risk based on its measured likelihood and impact.

    - **Likelihood** is the probability that the event will occur and **impact** is a measure of how bad it would be.

    - There is an additional metric, called **risk factor**, which is the number you get from multiplying likelihood by impact.

    - For example, if a risk has a likelihood of 20 and an impact of 20, its risk factor would be 400.

- :question: **Ask class**: What is the risk factor for a likelihood of 10 and an impact of 30?

    - **Answer**: 300.

Explain that not every scenario is easily qualitative. Likewise, other scenarios are difficult to quantify. In the next section, we will differentiate between scenarios that call for each risk analysis methodology.

#### Qualitative Risk Analysis

Qualitative Risk Analysis is useful because accurately assigning likelihood and impact can be difficult if not impossible.

  - It's impossible to calculate a precise probability that some malicious attacker, somewhere in the world, will attack your servers within the next four quarters.

  - It's impossible to precisely determine the fallout of a breach. For example; a company might face the risk of a DDoS attack against its core web servers. The cost of this attack depends on how long the attack lasts, which is impossible to determine ahead of time.

Explain that qualitative analysis is typically much faster than quantitative risk analysis,and for high-level problems, might be just as effective.

  - For example: a baking company might be deciding between an inexpensive VPN service that logs traffic on its servers for internal use and a more expensive service that does _not_ keep any logs.

  - In this case, a simple qualitative analysis might lead to the conclusion that the less expensive VPN is suitable, since it shouldn't much matter if they're logging non-confidential information.

  - A defense organization, on the other hand, would probably opt for the more expensive service, as it would prefer to leave no traces.

In either case, a complex evaluation of cost versus benefit is unnecessary.

#### Quantitative Risk Analysis

On the other hand, there are circumstances where intuitive analysis is insufficient. The following scenarios require quantitative analysis:

  - The Security Department wants to invest in protecting the organization's infrastructure. In order to secure the money from the Finance Department, they must justify their ask. So, they present a quantitative risk analysis to demonstrate that the cost of _not_ investing is much greater than the budget they're requesting.

  - The Executive Team needs to decide whether to migrate to a new cloud provider as part of negotiations with a potential partner. This transition has major financial implications, so they wouldn't make the decision without accurate assessment of potential losses due to downtime, retraining, risk of data corruption during migration, etc.

Reassure students that risk analysts use a well-defined methodology to determine the likelihood and potential impact of a given risk.

- :question: **Ask class**: What's main the difference between qualitative and quantitative analysis?

    - **Answer**: Quantitative analysis focuses on hard, numerical data. Qualitative analysis focuses on the aspects that cannot be measured through numerical data. 
    
#### Asset Value and Exposure Factor

Explain that in order to perform quantitative Risk Analysis, analysts start by calculating how much it costs if an asset is breached. To calculate this, they first quantify **asset value** and **exposure factor**.

- We've previously covered that **asset value** is how much money the asset is worth in dollars.

  - In the case of a web application's core application server, the asset value would probably be the _amount of revenue or profit_ generated by that server, _not_ the price of the server itself.

- Analysts also consider how exposure to an attack can result in either partial/temporary or complete/permanent destruction of an asset. For example, a DDoS attack might take down a server for a few hours, whereas a fire would destroy it for good.

- Analysts quantify this **exposure factor** by measuring "how much" of an asset will be affected in the event of a breach.

  - Exposure factor is always somewhat subjective. Analysts should start by estimating whether the occurrence of a risk would completely eliminate (1.0), mostly eliminate (0.75), half eliminate (0.5), partially eliminate (0.25), or not affect (0.0) an asset's ability to function.

  - For instance, consider the risk of attackers DDoS-ing one of an organization's web application servers. If the network has another backup server, the exposure factor might be 0.5, because the attack takes down roughly half of the application's ability to generate profit.

  - For the risk of attackers DDoS-ing all of an organization's application servers, the exposure factor would be 1.0.

- :question: **Ask class**: A mail server that's reduced to 0% functionality during a power outage has an exposure factor of what? 

    - **Answer**: Exposure factor of 1.

#### Loss Expectancies

Explain that **loss expectancy** is a measure of how much money an organization will lose in the event of a given breach.

- There are two common methods of measuring loss expectancy:

  - Single loss expectancy (SLE)

  - Annual loss expectancy (ALE)

Explain that analysts use exposure factor and asset value to calculate the number they're actually interested in: **single loss expectancy (SLE)**.

- Define **single loss expectancy** as the estimated cost of the occurrence of a risk on a given asset.


   - It is calculated as: SLE = AV x EF, where SLE is single loss expectancy, AV is asset value, and EV is exposure factor..


  - **SLE** is the estimated cost each time the risk occurs. If it happens twice, the total cost would be twice the SLE.

- Define **annual loss expectancy** as the metric determining the cost of a risk re-occurring.


  - It is calculated as: ALE = ARO x SLE, where ALE is annual loss expectancy, ARO is annual rate of occurrence, and SLE is single loss expectancy.


- Define **annual rate of occurrence** as an estimate of how many times a risk is likely to occur in a given year.

  - For example: one might assume a physical break-in would only happen once per year, at most. However, one should guess that phishing attacks could happen as often as monthly.

  - **ARO** is calculated as follows: ARO = X / years, ARO is annual rate of occurrence, X occurrence(s), and years is per number of years.

    - (ex. 1) 2 attacks every 3 years is ARO = 2 / 3. ARO would be .67.
    - (ex. 2) 1 attack every 2 years is ARO = 1 / 2. ARO would be .25.

- :question: **Ask class**: With an asset value of $10,000 and an exposure factor of .5, what would the single loss expectancy be?

    - **Answer**: SLE = AV x EF (10,000 x .5 = 5,000).


Explain that loss expectancy can be used to categorize a breach's impact as marginal, notable, severe, or catastrophic.

  - **Marginal**: The organization has sufficient resources to respond to the breach immediately, without affecting day-to-day operations or revenue.

  - **Notable**: The organization has sufficient resources to respond to the breach, but may not be able to do so immediately. It may experience interruptions to operations.

  - **Severe**: The organization experiences serious interruptions to operations, and does not have sufficient monetary and/or personnel resources to respond to the breach effectively. It may have to defer revenue, delay project timelines, reassign employees, and/or hire consultants to address the issue.

  - **Catastrophic**: The organization suffers severe, lasting damage to its reputation and/or infrastructure. The future of the business is threatened by reputational damage, bankruptcy, being found in contempt of federal regulations, etc.

Let students know that different organizations use different categories and thresholds, but these categories will be used throughout today's lesson.

#### Risk Factor and Heat Maps

Explain that these assessments also make it possible to generate charts that make it easier to understand how risks "stack up". Today, we'll focus on: risk matrices and heat maps.

- A **risk matrix** is used to compare how many of the risks an organization faces are mild to how many are severe.

- A **heat map** is a visual representation of the probability and likelihood of risks to an organization. Heat maps provide organizations with the capability to make strategic decisions designed to protect the company.

  - During a risk assessment, having the ability to visualize risks provides a holistic view of risks that affect an organization.

  - Heat maps display three relative values:

    - **Probability**: measured from bottom (low) to top (high).
    - **Impact**: measured from left (low) to right (high).
    - **Inherent Risk Score**: indicated by a dot within a quadrant relative to the values defined in the graph. 

  - Areas of high concern are displayed in the upper right quadrant of the heat map.
  - Areas of low concern are displayed in the lower right quadrant of the heat map.

#### Demonstration: The Risk Spreadsheet

Explain that risk analysts typically use spreadsheets to automate the calculation of these metrics. In this section, we'll take a look at one.

|                                                    :warning: Probability and Impact Values :warning:                                                    |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| When creating the heat map, only add probability and impact values of 10, 20, 30, or 40. Otherwise, the heat map will malfunction.  |


1. Open the spreadsheet and conduct this activity in **Google Sheets**: 

   - [Risk Analysis Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gwNSDxTnVOv7d8PXXZCjZl00ymtKwQjkWCKD1IaMC-A/edit#gid=1384626883) 
   
   - Make a copy by navigating to  **File** > **Make a Copy**.

   - Once you have made a copy, call attention to each of the tabs at the bottom of the sheet: **Risk Assessment**, **Risk Matrix**, **Heat Map**, **Risk Ratings**.

2. Click on **Risk Ratings** and explain that this tab documents how GeldCorp categorizes probability (likelihood) and impact.

    - They rate probability based on expected annual rate of occurrence.

    - They rate impact based on cost. It falls into one of four categories: marginal, noticeable, severe, catastrophic.

    - Note that the score choices are 10, 20, 30, or 40, and students will use these ratings to fill out the **Risk Assessment** tab.

3. Click the **Risk Assessment** tab and explain the columns:

    - **Risk ID**: The numerical ID for the risk.

    - **Risk Description**: A textual description of the risk.

    - **Likelihood**: Probability that the event will happen. This is 10, 20, 30, or 40.

    - **Impact**: Monetary impact of the event. This is 10, 20, 30, or 40.

    - **Risk Factor**: This is the product of likelihood and impact.

    - **Concat**: Puts the likelihood and impact numbers together directly.

      - For example: A likelihood of 10 and impact of 30 produce 1,030. This is used as a label in charts, and makes it easy to see if a risk has a high risk factor because of high probability, high impact, or both.

    - **Risk ID**: This is the same as the first column, but used by the Heat Map.

    - **Probability Class**: A likelihood of 10 indicates there is at most a 25% chance the risk occurs in a year (relatively unlikely), 20 indicates there is at most a 50% chance, 30 indicates at most a 75% chance, and 40 indicates at most a 100% chance (potentially very likely)

4. Explain that the numbers 10, 20, 30, and 40 are used to map the categories of marginal, noticeable, severe, and catastrophic to numbers.

    - Note that this spreadsheet does not require you to explicitly calculate asset value, exposure factor, SLE, or ALE. They should estimate the ALE directly and use this to determine their impact rating.

5.  Click the **Risk Matrix** tab, and explain that this compares risks according to likelihood and impact which were entered on the Risk Assessment.

6. Click the **Heat Map** tab, and explain that this visualizes risks according to likelihood and impact based on what was entered on the Risk Assessment.

7. Explain that the **Heat Map** auto-populates as students fill in the **Risk Assessment** tab. 

8. Explain that on the **Heat Map**, blue dots are added for each risk which were entered on the risk Assessment tab.

9. Remind the students that:
     - Risks of high concern are displayed by the blue dots in the upper right quadrant of the heat map.
     - Risks of low concern are displayed by the blue dots the lower right quadrant of the heat map.

10. Explain that an organization will use this completed Heat Map to help prioritize the risks

Review the likelihood and impact for each of these risks. Ask the class what risks they came up and how they assigned their likelihood and impact.

### 09. Instructor Do: Mitigating Risk (0:10)

Explain that analysts rank risks to clarify which threats are worth investing in solutions for. In the final section of the class, we'll look at recommending controls for the most critical risks.

#### Deciding on Security Controls

Explain that determining an appropriate control entails answering the following questions:

  - **Required Control Type**: Should the control be physical, administrative, or technical? Should it be protective, preventive, deterrent, corrective, or detective in nature? Sometimes multiple types of controls might be appropriate.

  - **Required Strength of Control**: How strong does the control _really_ need to be? An organization could require everyone to encrypt their disks and refresh their passwords weekly, but it probably doesn't need to.

  - **Cost of Implementation**: How much does the control cost, relative to how much protection it provides and how much is needed?

  - **Time to Implementation**: How long will it take to implement this control? Sometimes an imperfect but more immediate fix is better than the a fully general solution you can only implement later.

Explain that in addition, students should consider what resources their client has available when deciding on controls. Some organizations will be able to afford "proper" solutions, while others might only be able to implement something "good enough."

#### Mitigation Example

Provide the following scenario as an example of a risk mitigation method:

 
  - LifeNotes is a new medical records company that makes it easy for doctors from different hospitals to share medical records with each other. When they need to transfer a patient to another hospital or physician, they can use the application to send the patient's medical history, lab results, medication schedules, etc.  LifeNotes also ensures that doctors can only see records for their own patients.

    The app functions like "Google for medical records." To use it, doctors enter a password to log in; search for a patient by name; select the correct patient; and can then see the patient's records.

    However, a client recently reported that they were able to load records for patients they were not assigned to. They noticed this because they accidentally clicked on the wrong search result, but were still able to load that patient's medical details.

    This violates regulatory standards for protecting patient medical information, and must be resolved immediately.


Point out that this is a security issue because it violates client-data **confidentiality**.

:question: **Ask class**: Ask a few different students to suggest controls for this problem. 

Discuss the following example solutions:

- **Required Control Type**

  - Since this problem must be fixed immediately, LifeNotes must implement a corrective control. They should also implement protective controls to prevent the issue from reoccurring.

  - They can accomplish this with either administrative or technical controls.

- **Required Control Strength**

  - The corrective control must completely resolve the issue, since the bug means LifeNotes is in violation of the law.

  - The protective control(s) must completely prevent this issue from reoccurring, for the same reason.

- **Control**: LifeNotes can implement the following example controls:

  - As a corrective control, they can redeploy the older version of the application, which did not have this issue.

  - As an administrative preventive control, they can require doctors to transfer records to the target hospital, and then have the hospital pass those records on to the specific doctor who needs them.

  - As a technical preventive control, they can require doctors to provide a password to log in, and also provide their Employee ID to load a specific patient's records. This is called **two-factor authentication**.

- **Cost of Implementation**

  - **Low cost**: Rolling back to an older version of the application.

  - **High cost**: Changing the way doctors and hospitals communicate data to one another. This requires both that their clients to change their processes, and that LifeNotes change the way their application works.

  - **Medium cost**: Implementing two-factor authentication. It requires that the engineering team implement a new feature, and that doctors learn a new workflow. However, this is an acceptable amount of work for both doctors and developers, as this control the issue entirely.

- **Time to Implementation**

  - Rolling back to an older version of the application should take less than a day.

  - The administrative control would take months to implement.

  - Implementing two-factor authentication probably takes about a quarter.

Emphasize that there might be many controls relevant to any given issue.

- Let students know that they'll have an opportunity to decide on controls for GeldCorp in the upcoming exercise.

Take a moment to address questions before proceeding.

### 10. Student Do: Threat Modeling Step 6: Mitigating Risk (0:15)

In this activity, students will conceptualize a risk mitigation plan.

Explain the following:

- You will continue to play the role of security consultants contracted to advise the financial technology firm GeldCorp.

-  With the analysis obtained in the previous exercise, we will advise GeldCorp as to how to address the risks you identified.

:globe_with_meridians: This activity will use the same breakout room groups as the previous activity. 


Send students the following file:

- [Activity File: Threat Modeling Step 6: Mitigating Risk](Activities/10_Mitigating_Risk/Unsolved/README.md)

See if students have any questions before completing the activity.


### 11. Instructor Review: Threat Modeling Step 6: Mitigating Risk Activity (0:10)

:bar_chart: Using [Zoom's](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings) or [Slack's](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) poll feature, conduct a comprehension check and evaluate how well students completed the activity. 

Using the following file, review the solutions of the previous activity:  

- [Solution Guide: Threat Modeling Step 6: Mitigating Risk](Activities/10_Mitigating_Risk/Solved/README.md)

If time permits, have each group present on each risk and the security control(s) they came up with. Ask other groups if they considered different controls.

#### Walkthrough

Refer to the risk analysis you performed previously and identify all of the risks you should monitor, manage, or mitigate.

- XSS Injection Used to Hook Web-App Users' Browsers
- SQL Injection Used to Dump Database
- Engineer Downloads Backdoor Into Corporate Intranet
- Employee Steals Trading Algorithms from Technology Database**

Suggest a security control for each risk. For each control, provide the following:  

- XSS Injection Used to Hook Web-App Users' Browsers

  - **Recommendation**: Use a framework to handle user input
  - **Type**: Technical
  - **Intent**: Preventive
  - **Time to Implementation**: One quarter
  - **Cost of Implementation**: Low (<$10k). Engineers must simply refactor existing code.

- SQL Injection Used to Hook Web-App Users' Browsers

  - **Recommendation**: Use a framework to handle user input
  - **Type**: Technical
  - **Intent**: Preventive
  - **Time to Implementation**: One quarter
  - **Cost of Implementation**: Low (<$10k). Engineers must simply refactor existing code.

- Employee Downloads Backdoor Into Corporate Intranet

  - **Recommendation**: Install antivirus over whole Enterprise domain
  - **Type**: Technical
  - **Intent**: Preventive
  - **Time to Implementation**: Very fast
  - **Cost of Implementation**: Very Low (<$10). Cost is mostly due to licensing the software.

- Engineer Steals Trading Algorithms from Technology Database

  - **Recommendation**: Restrict access to databases containing confidential information.
  - **Type**: Technical
  - **Intent**: Preventive
  - **Time to Implementation**: Very fast
  - **Cost of Implementation**: Very Low (<$10). Cost is mostly due to licensing the software.

Finally, rank these issues from least to most important, taking into consideration how much each solution costs.
