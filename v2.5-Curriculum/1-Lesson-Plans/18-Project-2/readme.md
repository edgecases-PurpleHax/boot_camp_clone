## Module 18 README: Project 2

### Module Description

In the second project week, students will use the skills that they have learned in the Offensive Security unit to attack a fictional organization and determine its vulnerabilities. On **Day 1**, students will attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on the organization's web application. On **Day 2**, students will exploit the organization's Linux servers, and on **Day 3**, they'll exploit the organization's Windows servers. The project is structured as a Capture the Flag (CTF) style competition, so that each vulnerability that students exploit correlates with a "flag," and flags are worth various point amounts depending on the difficulty level of the exploit.

### Module Objectives

  <br>

- **Day 1**: Students will be provided a fictional organization's web application that has a variety of vulnerabilities. Students will be tasked with finding flags as they exploit these vulnerabilities.

- **Day 2**: Students will continue to exploit the fictional organization, but will focus on the organization's Linux servers and vulnerabilities related to Linux operating systems. Students will continue finding flags during their exploitation.

- **Day 3**: Students will continue to exploit the fictional organization, but will focus on the organization's Windows servers and vulnerabilities related to Windows operating systems. Students will continue finding flags during their exploitation.

### Lab Environment

For the majority of this week's demonstrations and activities, the class will use an Azure Lab that contains each day's activities.

    
### Module Checklist

Before beginning to prep this week's project, be sure you have the following accessible within your lab.  Please notify the curriculum team as soon as possible if any of the following is not available.

- [x] Kali
- [x] Win10  
- [x] WINDC01

### What to Be Aware of:

  - For each day of this week's project, you will need to create the Capture the Flag environment where the students will enter their found flags.  
    - This environment will also keep score for your students.
    - Be sure to set this up BEFORE class each day!
    - Your admin credentials for the CTFd site will be reset each time you update the daily CTF to the following:
       - user: `admin`
       - password: `ctfpassword`
  
  - On Day 1, it is very important that students follow the exact steps of setting up their web application. Specifically, students must pull the most current  docker container before bringing it up. The instructions to enable the web application are listed in three steps in their guide.

  - In addition to a review of the Offensive Security unit, this week's project is also a student competition.
  - You can choose whether to announce daily CTF winners or cumulative winners over the three days of the project.
    - If you decide on cumulative winners, be sure to keep track of the team's daily scores, as each day's scores will be lost when you upload the next day's CTF.
