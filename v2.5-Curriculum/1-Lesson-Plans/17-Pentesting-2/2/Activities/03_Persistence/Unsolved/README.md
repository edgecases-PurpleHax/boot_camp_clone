## Activity File: Windows Persistence

Now that we have SYSTEM access over the machine, we will establish persistence on it to ensure our SYSTEM access. This technique will utilize Task Scheduler. We will create a scheduled task that will execute a custom Meterpreter payload.

- You will establish persistence on the Window10 machine by abusing Task Scheduler. 

- This will allow your payload to be executed at a certain defined interval, ensuring you always have a reverse shell to the target.

### Instructions

You will work off your Meterpreter session on the Window10 machine. If you do not have an active session on the WIN10 machine, refer to prior activities to obtain a Meterpreter shell.

1. In your Meterpreter session, drop into a `shell` session.

2. Create a scheduled task that will execute your payload every day at midnight.  

3. Test your scheduled task. 

4. How could you improve this technique to make it more stealthy?
