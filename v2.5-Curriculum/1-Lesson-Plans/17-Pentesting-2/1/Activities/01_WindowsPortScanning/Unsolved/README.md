## Activity File: Windows Port Scanning

In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a pentester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne. After compromising a Linux server in MegaCorpOne's internal network, you've now turned your focus to Windows machines. Since it's been a week since the last port scan, we will re-conduct scanning in order to determine if any Windows machines are on the network. Remember that Windows will have different services and ports open than Linux.

- You will use Nmap to scan the network once again, this time looking for any Windows machines. 

- Windows machines will always have unique ports open, and Nmap has the ability to infer the operating system based on the services running from these ports. 

- This scan will give you an idea of what machines to target next. 

### Instructions

On your Kali machine, perform an Nmap scan of the network you're on, then answer a few questions. 

1. Perform `ip addr` to identify your IP address, and perform an Nmap scan on that subnet (/24) to identify all machines on that network.

2. Based on the result of your scan, answer the following questions:
	1. How many Windows machines are on the network?
	2. What ports/services are open on the machines that suggest that they're Windows machines?
	3. Can you tell which machine is the domain controller?
