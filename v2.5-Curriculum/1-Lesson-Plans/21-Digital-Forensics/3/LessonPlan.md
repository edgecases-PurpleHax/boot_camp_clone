### 01. Instructor Do: Welcome and Overview (0:05)

Welcome students to the third day of the digital forensics module. Review what we covered in the last class:

- Identifying methods used in smartphone forensics.
- Examining databases and file structures of an iPhone directory image.
- Locating and documenting evidence of ownership for an iPhone image.
- Using Autopsy to view and tag evidence of an iPhone image.
- Extracting data for use in other applications (logs, text, pictures, video, audio).


We will begin class with a warm-up activity. Explain the following:

- As a forensic investigator, it's critical that you understand how to use tools such as Autopsy, and how to export data so other team members can perform offline analysis of evidence.

- .emlx is a file extension called Mail Message thatâ€™s used to store email messages.

- EMLX files are often referred to as Apple Mail files because they are created with Apple's mail program to store plain text files for a single message.


### 02. Student Do: Email Export (0:15)

Explain the following:

- In this activity, you will continue your role as a digital forensic investigator.

- Your task is to export the email database for offline analysis using examination tools outside of Autopsy.

Send students the following:

- [Activity File: Email Export](Activities/02_Email_Export/Unsolved/README.md)


### 03. Instructor Review: Email Export Activity (0:10)

This activity reinforced students' knowledge of Autopsy's export functions.

Reiterate the following concepts:

- File exports enable database information to be easily transferred to spreadsheets or word documents, where it can be integrated into reports and analyzed by other teams.

Completing this activity required the following steps:

- Use a keyword search to locate Tracy's email files.
- Perform a single file export for Tracy's emails.
- Verify the export to see if the EMLX files were successfully created in the `Export` directory.

Verify that all students successfully exported the emails.

### 04. Instructor Do: Tracy's Email Evidence (0:10)

Explain that we already exported Tracy's emails to the `Export` directory during the warm-up activity.

Now we'll use offline analysis to uncover details about the plot of the crime and possibly identify the co-conspirators and the roles they played.

#### Importance of Emails

Explain that we can extract critical information from emails, such as:

- Sender's email address
- Sender's IP address
- Internet Service Provider
- User client (email app)
- Location information

Point out that all of this information plays an important role in conducting a digital forensics investigation.

#### Examine Emails in Kali Linux

Explain that we will demonstrate how to display email messages in the `INBOX.mbox/Messages` folder.

- These emails were exported to the `INBOX.mbox/Messages` folder in Kali Linux during the warm-up activity.

Open a terminal window and navigate into the directory that contains the `INBOX.mbox` directory.  

- Run `ls -l` to see the full contents of the `Messages` folder.

Explain that within each of these EMLX files is a single email conversation string.

   ![Email 1](Images/A-Images/1.png)

#### Search for Contact Information

In the next activity, students will continue their investigation by using Nano to view the contents of each EMLX file, as shown below.

   ![Email 1](Images/A-Images/2.png)
  - They will also look at any email attachments and tag items of interest in Autopsy.

The following diagram provides a high-level overview of the threat actor's involvement in the 2012 National Gallery Case.

  - Students should use this as a roadmap to tie Tracy's associates to each incident.

     ![Email 1](Images/A-Images/diagram.png)

 Review the following worksheet with students:

-  The [Correspondence Evidence Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zS-QDGYhMnbZZrwcapIrwdn73fUoh3MSkaZCcX-7LUM/edit?usp=sharing) is used to document evidence from the communications (i.e., phone calls, emails, text messages) found on Tracy's phone. Students should complete this as a group.

  - Students will fill out the following information:

      - Artifact numbers to help organize records
      - Timestamp (time email was sent or received)  
      - Header information
        - These should include names of the individuals involved, their email addresses, and the email subject line.
      - Key information
        - Summary of the email contents.
      - Evidence location
        - Source of the data (For example, Email, SMS, Phone call, etc. )

### 06. Break (0:10)

### 07. Instructor Review: Tracy's Email Evidence Activity (0:10)

In the previous activity, students looked for evidence in Tracy's email communication relevant to the case.

- It's important for digital forensic investigators to have a clear understanding of how to perform email forensics.

- By examining Tracy's emails, we were able to uncover evidence that tied Tracy and her co-conspirators to the case.

- Emails provide a wealth of information that can be used to identify people involved in crimes and provide possible motives.

Completing this activity required the following steps:

- Use Nano to view and examine Tracy's emails.
- Use Autopsy's keyword search to locate email attachments.
- Document our findings by updating the Evidence Worksheet.

Send students the following solution file and worksheet answers and use them to guide your review.

- [Email Correspondence Evidence Worksheet Solution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Np5KQ0dcsmpqgcll321yXXdV9nWYWnxCeyIv8JNJjXA/edit?usp=sharing)


Pause to answer questions before proceeding.


### 08. Instructor Do: Tracy's SMS Messages (0:10)

Explain that in our last activity, we were able to identify an email attachment called `needs.txt` that contained a list of tools intended to assist with carrying out the crime.

We'll continue to search for more evidence by examining Tracy's SMS messages.

- Explain **SMS** messaging as follows:

   - SMS messages are what you know as text messages. SMS stands for "short message service" and is a person-to-person communication method.

   - SMS messages can be no more than 918 characters.

   - SMS messages can and have been used in DoS attacks.

   - **Smishing** is the term used to refer to a social engineering attack performed using SMS messages.

#### Forensic Analysis of SMS Messages Demonstration

Now, we will perform a short demonstration to view the SMS entries contained in the iPhone image.

There are four methods we can use to view these entries:

**Method 1**

 1. From the **Tools** menu, select **File Search by Attribute**.

 1. Click the box next to **Name** and type `sms.db`.

 1. Click the **Search** button.

 1. Select `sms.db` from the **Listing** pane.

 1. Select the **Indexed Text** tab in the **Data Content** pane to see Tracy's messages.


**Method 2**

Click the custom tag that you created earlier to load the `sms.db` file.

   - We can read this in the **Data Content** pane.

   ![Images/sms-text-messages.png](Images/A-Images/sms_lp.png)

**Method 3**

Since this is a database file, we can also use a tool like SQLite Browser to read the messages.

  ![Images/method3-1.png](Images/method-3.1.png)

 - Navigate to **Browse Data** and then the **message** table.

   ![Images/method3.png](Images/method-3.png)

**Method 4**

Alternatively, we can export the file and use the Nano editor to read the messages.  

 ![Images/sms-text-messages.png](Images/sms-text-messages.png)

- In a real case, we'd want to hash everything before exporting and making any changes.

- For this investigation, you will need to associate phone numbers contained within the SMS messages to specific contacts.

Pause to answer any questions before proceeding.
