        - Virtual network with IP address range
        - Subnet range
        - Flow of specific traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH)
        - Security group blocking traffic
        - Load balancer
        - All five VMs that you have launched
        - Where Docker and Ansible are deployed
        - Availability Zones
