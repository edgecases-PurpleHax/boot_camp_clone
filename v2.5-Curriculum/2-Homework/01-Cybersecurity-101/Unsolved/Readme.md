## Week 1 Security 101 Homework: Security Reporting

Congratulations on completing the first week of your cybersecurity program!

We covered _a lot_ this week, especially in the Security Challenge activities. It begs the question: how do security professionals stay informed and updated on the threats, defenses, and infosec information necessary to be effective in the field? The answer is by reading and staying up to date on prominent **reports**, **blogs**, and **research papers**.

- In your first homework, you will read through three prominent security reports and answer questions in order to get a basic understanding of the market. These reports contain a lot of information and some of the language might feel esoteric. 

- The goal of this assignment is for you to get exposure and learn how to navigate through these reports. This is a critical skill. 

- This assignment is report-heavy, but know that research and reporting are massively important to the work of a cybersecurity professional. 

- In addition to the reports, there are three worksheets that you will fill out while reading through the papers. These should guide what you pay attention to while reading the reports, and should help you understand the research. 

### Instructions

You have been provided the following reports. Download them to get started.  

* CrowdStrike Global Threat Report (2021) 
* Akamai Security Year in Review (2020) 
* Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report 

Complete the following worksheet as you navigate through the papers. This worksheet should help you identify the topics and keywords to pay close attention to. 

* [Security 101 Challenge Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17kXYMZ1rIGGR8I-wCzDh0GsYBRUPlyIyM8RYBzPFx2E/edit) 

**Note:** To write in these documents, make a copy of each worksheet. 

- Navigate to **File** in the Google Docs toolbar and select **Make a copy**.

### Submission Guidelines

* After you complete your worksheets, add them to a newly created Google Drive folder. Title the folder with the following format: < YOUR NAME >< Security 101 HW> 

* Allow anyone accessing the folder to comment on it. 

* Submit the URL of the Google Drive folder in Bootcamp Spot.
