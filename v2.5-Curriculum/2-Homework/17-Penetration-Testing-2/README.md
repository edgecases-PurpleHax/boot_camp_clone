## Homework: Penetration Test Report

In this activity, you will record your activities and form a report that will be turned in as a deliverable to the CISO of MegaCorpOne. Remember that the report is the most important part of an engagement, as it is a story of what findings you discovered and how you discovered them. Even if you perform an assessment where all objectives were complete, if you submit a poor report, it will appear to the customer as if you did a poor quality assessment. 

This report will be for both modules of penetration testing. It is recommended to fill it out as you go along to shorten the time outside of class needed to complete it. 

### Setup 

- To help you document your findings, a [template has been prepared.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wDIaTVbfBMQyhqnYpsTeAEPFpNj3eTDTnXDg1l8D1x0/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)

	- Please **do not** write in the template. Make a copy for yourself. 

- You do not have to use the template if you wish, however it is encouraged as it includes the necessary information normally contained within a report.

### Understanding The Report Template
 
#### Introduction, Methodology, Contact Info, and Scope

Following the format within the template, fill out any areas that are highlighted. While the client name should remain 'MegaCorpOne', your penetration testing firm name is up to you to makeup. Several paragraphs can be unchanged, as these are commonly referred to "boiler-plate" content -- content in which has standard language without client-specific details. 

Once you reach the contact information section, you do not have to fill in real personal data, but make sure the data is realistic. 

Scope should remain unchanged unless your instructor tells you otherwise.

#### Executive Summary of Findings

An 'Executive Summary' is something a less-technical executive (CEO, CISO, CTO, etc.) can read and understand the path and outcome of the assessment. Once you reach the 'Executive Summary of Findings' section, fill in the highlighted areas by documenting the strengths and weaknesses found during the assessment. Avoid using overtly negative phrases during the 'Summary of Weaknesses' section such as 'MegaCorpOne's network security was terrible and this assessment was easy'. Remember to keep it professional.

The Executive Summary should not include details of every action you took during the assessment and instead should include a high level overview of the steps you took during the assessment.

#### Summary Vulnerability Overview & Findings

The Vulnerability Findings section should include details around the discovered vulnerabilities. This is where detailed information should be included, including screenshots. This section is meant to be more detail-oriented for system administrators or vulnerability management personnel who can understand the vulnerability and come up with a remediation plan based off the content.

#### MITRE ATT&CK Navigator

As you've gone through the Penetration Testing weeks, you've constantly been taught to attribute techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) to MITRE ATT&CK. In this section, you will fill out a graph which highlights which TTPs you performed and if they were successful or unsuccessful. This allows someone reading the report a quick glance into what TTPs were used in the assessment and if they were successful.

Using https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/ build out a map of what techniques you’ve used so far. Click the MITRE link, then “Create New Layer,” then “Enterprise.” Select each technique that you’ve used so far, and change the color to yellow to highlight it if it was successful, or red if it was unsuccessful. An example is shown in the report template.

### Deliverable

Once you complete this assignment, submit your findings in a Google Document and submit the link to Canvas.
