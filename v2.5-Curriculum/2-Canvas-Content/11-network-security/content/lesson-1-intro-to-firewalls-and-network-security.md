## Lesson 1: Introduction to Firewalls and Network Security 
 
### Overview

This module introduces network security through the principles of network defense. 

Today, we will review the relationship of ports and services, including the role of open ports as the principal **attack surface** of networked machines. Then, we'll cover how firewalls are used to control access to a machine's open ports, protecting the machine from attackers on the network. You'll apply these concepts in exercises that require Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) and firewalld configurations.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Explain how open ports contribute to a computer's attack surface.

- Use firewalls to protect a computer's open ports.

- Develop and implement firewall policies using UFW and firewalld.

### Today’s Activities

* **Configuring UFW**: In this activity, you'll configure UFW by setting various firewall rules and observing their effects against the network.

* **firewalld Configuration**: In this activity, you'll configure firewalld, a dynamically managed firewall that supports both network and firewall zones through trust-level definitions of network connections and interfaces.

* **Testing Firewall Rules with Nmap**: In this activity, you'll use Nmap to test your firewall's defenses. You'll use some of the scan types that attackers most commonly use to identify the firewall's strengths and weaknesses.
