# Introduction to Module 11

## Introduction to Module 11

### Network Security

This week serves as an introduction to network security from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. We'll explore the benefits of using defense in depth methodologies and how firewalls serve as the network's primary defense mechanism at both the perimeter and interior of the network.

It's critical that network defenders not only stop attacks, but also learn from them. We will explore how to establish situational awareness of our networks by using detailed data analytics to learn about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries use to successfully infiltrate networks.

- Day 1 introduces firewalls. We'll examine the relationship between ports and services, including the role that open ports play as the principal attack surface of networked machines. Then, we'll cover how firewalls  control access to a machine's open ports.

- Day 2 covers intrusion detection systems (IDS) and network security monitoring (NSM). We will analyze indicators of attack and compromise (IOAs and IOCs), perform network forensics, and acquire adversarial intelligence and situational awareness of our networks.

- Day 3 focuses on threat hunting using the Enterprise security management (ESM) framework of network security tools. We'll examine ESM concepts and the role of host-based endpoint telemetry, simulate investigations, and perform alert triage using Kibana.

### What to Be Aware Of

- Days 2 and 3 will begin with a quick setup process so that our machines can generate alert data for the lab activities.

### Security+ Domains

This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities 
- 2.0 Architecture and Design 
- 3.0 Implementation
- 5.0 Governance, Risk, and Compliance

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource:

### This Week’s Lab Environment

In this module, you will use the NetSec lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. RDP into the Windows RDP Host machine using the following credentials:

  - Username: `azadmin`
  - Password: `p4ssw0rd*`

Open Hyper-V Manager to access the following machines:

  - Security Onion Machine

    - Username: `sysadmin`
    - Password: `cybersecurity`

  - UFW Machine

    - Username: `sysadmin`
    - Password: `cybersecurity`

  - firewalld Machine

    - Username: `sysadmin`
    - Password: `cybersecurity`


### Preview This Week’s Challenge

For this week's Challenge assignment, you will need to appropriately configure a firewall for a fictional organization.

### Looking Forward

Next week, we will move into the Web Development module, followed by the Cloud Security module.
