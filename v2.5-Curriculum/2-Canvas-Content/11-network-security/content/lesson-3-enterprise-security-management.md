## Lesson 3: Enterprise Security Management (ESM) 
 
### Overview

In today's class, we'll advance our network security knowledge by learning about enterprise security management (ESM) and how host-based OSSEC IDS technology plays a critical role in endpoint telemetry. We'll also learn how to investigate threats using Security Onion's Elastic Stack and a web-based data analytics visualization tool called Kibana.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Analyze indicators of attack for persistent threats.

- Use enterprise security management to expand an investigation.

- Use OSSEC endpoint reporting agents as part of a host-based IDS alert system.

- Investigate threats using various analysis tools.

- Escalate alerts to senior incident handlers.

### Today’s Activities

* **C2 Beacon**: In this activity, you will investigate a C2 beacon acknowledgement attack, including establishing an attacker profile with the TTPs used by the adversary, and document your findings.

* **Investigation, Analysis, and Escalation**: In this activity, you will use Squert and Kibana to investigate, analyze, and escalate indicators of attack.

* **Threat Hunting - Cyber Threat Intelligence**: In this exercise, you can use any tool that you've learned so far to hunt for a malicious threat to a network.
