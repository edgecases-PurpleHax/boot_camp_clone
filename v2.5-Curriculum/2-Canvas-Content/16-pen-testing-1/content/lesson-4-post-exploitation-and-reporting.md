## Lesson 4: Post-Exploitation and Reporting 
 
### Overview

Today, we will explore the Post Exploitation phase and common post-exploitation tasks in more depth. You will learn about re-performing enumeration after privilege escalation and how to gather password hashes on the machine and crack them offline with John the Ripper. You will then learn about establishing persistence by creating a back-door account. Finally, we'll introduce reporting and a report template, which you'll use for the final deliverable at the end of the next module.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
* Describe the common tasks that are included in privileged post exploitation.

* Perform post-exploitation tasks, such as gathering password hashes.

* Explain how password crackers work and perform password cracking.

* Understand the importance of reporting and fill out a strong report.

### Today’s Activities

* **Password Cracking**: In today's activities, you'll continue playing the role of a pentester performing an engagement against MegaCorpOne. Previously, you successfully elevated your privileges to a privileged user. In this activity, you'll re-perform enumeration as a high-privileged user to see what additional information you can gather, since you can now access more files. Specifically, you're tasked with cracking user hashes from the shadow file.

* **Persistence**: In this activity, you will conduct the post-exploitation task of persistence by adding an additional port for the SSH service to listen on, and then opening the port on a firewall. Then, you will create a privileged account to SSH to your new hidden port, so that you can re-access your target.

* **Reporting**: In this activity, you will work on a summary report of all the work you have completed this week.
