## Lesson 3: Exploring Exploitation 
 
### Overview

Today, you will continue in the Exploitation phase of a pen testing engagement. You will learn about **command and control (C2)** and how a penetration tester uses it. Today's class will also introduce our first exploitation and C2 framework, **Metasploit**. Then, you'll use Metasploit for automating exploitation to gain a reverse shell on a machine and perform privilege escalation on that machine to elevate your privileges to root.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
* Understand what command and control (C2) is and how it fits into a penetration tester's toolkit.

* Use Metasploit to automate exploitation activities.

* Explain what privilege escalation is and how it fits into the attack cycle.

* Perform basic privilege escalation tasks.

### Today’s Activities

* **C2 Research**: In this activity, you will research various C2 frameworks by using the [C2 Matrix website](https://www.thec2matrix.com/matrix) and suggesting the best C2 framework for your current assessment on MegaCorpOne.

* **Metasploit**: Through a previous Nmap scan, you discovered several MegaCorpOne services that are exploitable. In this activity, you are tasked with using the Metasploit framework to successfully obtain a reverse shell on the remote host using an exploit module.

* **Privilege Escalation**: You now have a low-privileged shell as the daemon user on the remote host. In this activity, you'll need to determine whether MegaCorpOne administrators are saving passwords in plain text on machines. Additionally, you'll perform post-exploitation tasks in order to do proper enumeration that could lead to privilege escalation.
