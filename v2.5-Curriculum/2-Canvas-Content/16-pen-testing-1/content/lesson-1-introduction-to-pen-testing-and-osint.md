### Overview

Today's class will introduce penetration testing and its value to an organization's security. We will discuss pen testing career pathways and then explore the first phase of pen testing using **open source intelligence (OSINT)** tools.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
* Understand the role of a pentester in assessing a business's security.

* Collect domain information by using OSINT techniques and tools like Google dorking, Shodan, and certificate transparency.

### Today’s Activities

* **Types of Penetration Testing**: In this activity, you'll begin playing the role of a consultant at the fictional company GoodCorp. In this activity, you'll review a list of potential contract opportunities and determine (1) whether each assessment is legal or illegal, and (2) the type of penetration test being requested.

* **Doogle Dorking**: In this activity, you'll begin your penetration testing engagement with the fictional company MegaCorpOne. You'll start by using Google dorking to find information pertaining to MegaCorpOne.

* **Shodan.io**: In this activity, you'll continue performing OSINT against MegaCorpOne by using Shodan.io.

* **Recon-ng**: In this activity, you will use the Shodan API and Recon-ng to perform tests and determine whether MegaCorpOne's domain server info is accessible using OSINT tools. You'll place all of your findings in a report.
