# Introduction to Module 14

## Introduction to Module 14

### Project 1

Today marks the beginning of our first project week! 

This week, you'll build, secure, and protect a cloud application that hosts your own cyber blog. This project will result in tangible deliverables that demonstrate your knowledge of cloud, cloud security, networking, web development, cryptography, and network security topics&mdash;deliverables that you can show to potential employers. 

### What to Be Aware Of

- You can choose to work independently or in groups, but you are **required** to remain in class.

- Each day's activities build on the previous day's to complete the project, and each day's activities must be completed **in order**.

- You will have **two** choices for selecting the domain of your website&mdash;a paid option and a free option&mdash;depending on your cost preference.
   - Your instructor will explain the pros and cons of each option.
   - Each day, you will follow specific project instructions based on your choice.
   - The choice is **completely voluntary**, and **the educational value of each option is the same**.
   - If you choose to purchase a domain, you can elect to cancel your domain for a full refund within five days of ordering.

### Security+ Domains

This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:
- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities / 2.0 Architecture and Design / 3.0 Implementation

### This Week’s Lab Environment

For the majority of this week's demonstrations and activities, you will use Microsoft Azure cloud services and the Azure cloud portal.

- You will **not** use any of the Azure lab environments. Instead, you will use your personal Azure account.
