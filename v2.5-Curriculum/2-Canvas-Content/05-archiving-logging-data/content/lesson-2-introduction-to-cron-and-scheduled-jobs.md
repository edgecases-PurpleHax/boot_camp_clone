## Lesson 2: Introduction to cron and Scheduled Job 
 
### Overview

In today's class, you'll learn how to use `cron` to schedule and automate important maintenance and security tasks such as moving files, updating packages, and running security scans. 
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Schedule regular jobs for individual users with crontab.

- Write simple scripts for maintenance and security tasks.

- Use `cron` to automate the execution of security scripts to perform maintenance on a regular basis.

### Today’s Activities

* **Simple Cron Jobs**: In this activity, you'll use `cron` to automate jobs in order to perform regularly scheduled backups of files that contain personal identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI).

* **Introduction to Scripts**: In this activity, you'll write scripts that use `cron` to automate various tasks, such as performing regular backups and scheduling regular software updates that help keep a system secure.

* **Scheduling Backups and Cleanups**: In this activity, you will add previously written shell scripts to system-wide cron jobs, allowing the scripts to become automated with root privileges. Then, you'll set up regular security scans with Lynis.

* **Reviewing `cron`**: In this activity, you'll review everything you've learned in this class, including `cron`, `tar`, and scripts.
