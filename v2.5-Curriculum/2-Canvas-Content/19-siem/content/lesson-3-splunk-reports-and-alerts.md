## Lesson 3: Splunk Reports and Alerts 
 
### Overview

In today's class, you'll expand their knowledge of Splunk in order to create more robust searches, reports, and alerts.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Use the SPL commands `stat` and `eval` to create new fields in Splunk.

- Schedule statistical reports in Splunk.

- Determine baselines of normal activity in order to trigger alerts.

- Design and schedule alerts to notify if an attack is occurring.

### Today’s Activities

* **Splunk Warm Up**: Today, you will continue to play the role of an SOC manager at OMP. In this activity, you will analyze logs from the OMP Fortinet IPS system, determine any issues, and offer mitigation strategies.

* **Splunk Statistics**: In this activity, you will create several statistical reports to illustrate details about the denial of service attack that you discovered.

* **Splunk Reports**: In this activity, you will schedule the statistical report that you built.

* **Baselining**: In this activity, you will review server logs from the past several days and create a baseline of normal hourly login attempts.

* **Creating and Scheduling Alerts**: Now that you have determined the baselines, in this activity, you will monitor the Windows servers for brute force attacks. You are tasked with designing and scheduling an alert to notify your team if a brute force attack is occurring.
