# Introduction to Module 19

## Introduction to Module 19

### SIEM

In this module, we will focus on one of the most popular types of software that security professionals use to monitor their environments: **SIEM**, which stands for **security information and event management**. While many different SIEM vendors exist in today's marketplace, we will primarily focus on one vendor: Splunk. This week we will learn about Splunk's core functionalities, and next week we will preview Splunk's SIEM product, Splunk Enterprise Security.

This first of two modules dedicated to SIEM will include the following:

- Day 1 will cover why and how businesses monitor their environment, how they use alerts to detect security events, and what makes SIEM such a powerful product for managing the many challenges of security monitoring.
- Day 2 will introduce a big data analysis tool called Splunk. We will learn how to use Splunk's Search and Reporting application to create basic and complex Splunk searches.
- Day 3 will build on the concepts covered on Day 2, exploring Splunk's reporting and alerting capabilities. We will also learn about the importance of "good" alerts and how to build them.

### What to Be Aware Of

At the end of Day 1, you will start to set up your Splunk environment inside of Vagrant. Be sure to attend office hours before Day 2 if you have any issues accessing the Splunk application.

### This Week’s Lab Environment

You will use your local Vagrant virtual machine for Day 2 and Day 3's activities. 

Use the following credentials:
- Username:`sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`

### Preview This Week’s Challenge

In this week's Challenge, you will develop Splunk searches, custom reports, and alerts to monitor a fictional company's security environment in order to protect them from future attacks.

### Looking Forward

Next week, we'll learn advanced Splunk skills, such as how to design visualizations and build dashboards. We will also preview Splunk's SIEM product, **Splunk Enterprise Security**, and introduce Splunk careers and certifications. We will conclude the week with a fun and challenging Splunk mini-project called Master of the SOC.
