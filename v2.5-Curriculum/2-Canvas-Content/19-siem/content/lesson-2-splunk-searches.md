## Lesson 2: Splunk Searches 
 
### Overview

In today's class, we will explore Splunk's interface, and you'll learn how to design complex search queries using Splunk's search processing language.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Explore and select Splunk add-ons and apps based on project needs.

- Upload logs into a Splunk repository.

- Write complex SPL queries to analyze specific security situations.

### Today’s Activities

* **Splunk Features**: Today, you will continue to play the role of a SOC manager at OMP. In this activity, you will analyze Splunk's add-ons and apps to determine whether any of them will work with your security products.

* **Uploading Data Into Splunk**: In this activity, you will upload several log files into your Splunk repository.

* **SPL Search**: In this activity, you will analyze the OMP's vulnerability scanning logs in order to determine the vulnerabilities of OMP's technical assets. To accomplish this, you will design SPL searches to run against the vulnerability scanning log file, `nessus.txt`.

* **Searching Fields with Splunk**: In this activity, you will create several complex SPL queries by selecting fields in your Splunk search.

* **Advanced Searches with Piping**: In this activity, you will run several advanaced searches to determine which OMP user is being targeted by an adversary.
