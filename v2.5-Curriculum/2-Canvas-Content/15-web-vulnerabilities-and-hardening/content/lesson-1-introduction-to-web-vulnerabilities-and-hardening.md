## Lesson 1: Introduction to Web Vulnerabilities and Hardening 
 
### Overview

Today's lesson will introduce web vulnerabilities and use the OWASP Top 10 list to categorize and prioritize these vulnerabilities. We will focus on injection vulnerabilities, specifically SQL injections and cross-site scripting.

 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
* Articulate the intended and unintended functionalities of a web application.

* Identify and differentiate between SQL and XSS injection vulnerabilities.

* Design malicious SQL queries using DB Fiddle.

* Create payloads from the malicious SQL queries to test for SQL injection against a web application.

* Design malicious payloads to test for stored and reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

### Today’s Activities

* **SQL Refresher and Unintended SQL Queries**: In this activity, you'll refresh your SQL skills by editing and running a SQL query that represents a simple request from a web application&mdash;and, you'll apply custom modifications to SQL queries to modify the output.

* **Testing SQL Injection on Web Applications**: In this activity, you'll input a malicious SQL payload into a field on a web application in order to cause unintended consequences.

* **Testing XSS on Web Applications**: In this activity, you'll design and apply malicious JavaScript payloads to test a live production website for stored (persistent) and reflected (non-persistent) cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
