## Lesson 3: Web Application Tool Time 
 
### Overview

Today's class is the final class of our introduction to web vulnerabilities. You will learn how cybersecurity professionals use tools to automate the discovery of vulnerabilities that exist within web applications, and you'll become familiar with tools such as web proxies and Burp Suite. You'll use Burp Suite to exploit identification and authentication vulnerabilities by conducting attacks such as session hijacking and brute force attacks. Finally, you'll learn some mitigation methods that you can use to protect against these exploits.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
* Identify ways in which web application security tools can assist with testing security vulnerabilities.

* Configure Burp Suite and Foxy Proxy to capture and analyze an HTTP request.

* Identify session management vulnerabilities using the Burp Suite Repeater function.

* Conduct a brute force attack against a web application login page with the Burp Intruder function.

### Today’s Activities

* **Configuring Burp Suite**: In this exercise, you'll check and set various settings on Burp Suite and the browser proxy tool Foxy Proxy. Then, you'll capture and inspect your first HTTP request with these tools while visiting the first website ever created.

* **Analyzing Session Management Vulnerabilities with Burp Repeater**: In this activity, you'll use the Repeater tool to find session management vulnerabilities. 

* **Conducting Brute Force Attacks with Burp Intruder**: In this activity, you'll use the Burp Intruder tool to conduct a brute force attack. You'll capture and view how payloads such as the username and password are passed into the HTTP request, and then you'll use Burp Intruder to automate using multiple payloads with a single request.
