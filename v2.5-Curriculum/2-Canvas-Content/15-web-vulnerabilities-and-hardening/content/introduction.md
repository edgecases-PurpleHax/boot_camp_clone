# Introduction to Module 15

## Introduction to Module 15

### Web Vulnerabilities and Hardening

This module begins our Offensive Security unit.

**Offensive security** means using proactive measures to protect networks, systems, and applications from malicious attacks. Doing so requires a thorough understanding of the technology&mdash;everything that we have done so far in this course has built up our knowledge to prepare us for the offensive security modules.

Now that you understand how systems and components properly operate, in this unit, we'll explore the weaknesses that can exist within them.

In this module, we'll specifically explore the weaknesses, or **vulnerabilities**, that exist within web applications, and how we can mitigate against those vulnerabilities.

### What to Be Aware Of

:warning: The techniques that we will learn throughout this module can be used to cause serious damage to an organization's systems. This is ILLEGAL when done without permission. 

The labs that we provide are safe locations to test the methods and tools taught during the week. You should NEVER apply any of these methods to any web applications that you do not own or do not have clear, written permission to  interact with.

### Security+ Domains

This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities 
- 2.0 Architecture and Design 
- 3.0 Implementation

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource:

### This Week’s Lab Environment

You will use your local Vagrant virtual machine for today's activities. 

**Next Week's Lab Environment**: At the end of Lesson 15.3, we will set up a new Azure Lab Environment for the Pentesting module.  

### Preview This Week’s Challenge

For this week's Challenge, you will test new several new web applications at a fictional organization for vulnerabilities.

### Looking Forward

Next week, we'll begin the first of our two modules on penetration testing.
