### Activities

1. Review this list of tips:
     - Attend as many office hour sessions throughout the week as you can.
     - Remember that you’re not alone, especially early in the course. If you’re struggling, others are too. Make connections. Help your peers, and ask for their help as needed. Set up a study group.
     - Connect with your student success manager (SSM) for non-curriculum support. Your SSM is dedicated entirely to your success and can guide you with any support that you need.
     - Focus on the big picture&mdash;beyond the specific skills of the week. A key element of this boot camp is getting comfortable researching and exploring new tools. This is a critical skill in the career space, and our industry is always evolving. Skills will change as technology changes, but the critical thinking techniques that you learn in this course will help you evolve with the field.
     - Celebrate your wins and those of your peers. If you’re feeling proud of a creation or a hurdle that you’ve overcome, share it in Slack!

3. Establish your weekly schedule. When will you review your notes? Work on the weekly Challenges? What are the best times for study groups or group project meetings?
