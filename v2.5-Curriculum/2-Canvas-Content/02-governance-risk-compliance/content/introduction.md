# Introduction to Module 2

## Introduction to Module 2

### Governance, Risk, and Compliance

In this module, we’ll introduce organizational security by providing a comprehensive overview of how different security fields connect with one another and with the overall needs of an organization.

We'll explore how effective security controls at various levels of an organization can create a healthy security culture. We will also perform risk analysis and threat modeling in order to conceptualize, quantify, and communicate the risk of threats to the proper managerial stakeholders.

In the final class of the module, we will expand our coverage of organizational security by discussing policy, compliance, and business continuity planning.

### What to Be Aware Of

On Day 2, we will use the OWASP threat modeling approach to cyber risk management and threat modeling.

We will use a macro-enabled, risk analysis spreadsheet that includes a heat map: [Risk Analysis Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gwNSDxTnVOv7d8PXXZCjZl00ymtKwQjkWCKD1IaMC-A/edit#gid=1384626883). 

* Editing access is not available for this document. In order to work in this file, you will need to make your own copy by navigating to **File** > **Make a copy**.

* When creating the heat map, only add probability and impact values of 10, 20, 30, or 40. Otherwise, the heat map will malfunction.

### Security+ Domains 

This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

* 5.0 Governance, Risk, and Compliance

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource:

* [CompTIA: Security+ Exam Objectives](https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia-security-sy0-601-exam-objectives-(2-0).pdf?sfvrsn=8c5889ff_2).

### Preview This Week’s Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will research some of the specific security risks that a fictional organization faces and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate these concerns.

### Looking Forward

Next week, we will start getting technical! In the Terminal and Bash module, you will work on the command line and learn how to navigate directories, modify files, and more.

We will use the Vagrant installations we set up last week. Make sure your Vagrant installation is working before the start of Module 3. If you need assistance or have any questions, consult with the instructional staff during office hours.
