# Introduction to Module 1

## Introduction to Module 1

### Security 101

Welcome to the Cybersecurity Boot Camp! 

In each module, this intro page will provide you with an overview of the module as well as technical lab information, a preview of the Challenge assignment, useful resources for the week, and a preview of whatâ€™s coming up in the next module.

In Module 1, we will introduce the courseâ€™s structure and some of the tools and topics that it will cover. Youâ€™ll install and set up the virtual machine environment that we will use throughout the course. Youâ€™ll also explore some fundamental cybersecurity concepts, like the CIA triad, and youâ€™ll work in groups to assess some basic attack and defense strategies.

On the final day of this module, weâ€™ll focus on professional pathways by exploring cybersecurity certifications and professions. Specifically, weâ€™ll introduce the Security+ exam, the domains that it covers, and how this class will prepare you to take that exam.

### What to Be Aware Of

* Throughout the course, we will use features on Zoom and Slack to optimize the online learning experience. These tools include breakout rooms for group activities and class polls to assess comprehension after activities.

* On Day 3, we will cover cybersecurity professional pathways and certifications. It is perfectly okay if you do not have a strong sense of the specific pathways you would like to pursue at this time. Over the next 24 weeks, this boot camp will present a wide scope of cybersecurity skills and domains, giving you the opportunity to narrow down your interests.

### Security+ Domains

On Day 3 of this module, we will introduce the Security+ exam and its domains. In the coming modules, we will provide details about many of the domains covered on the exam.

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource:

### This Weekâ€™s Lab Environment

On Day 2 of this module, youâ€™ll set up the virtual lab environment that youâ€™ll use throughout the boot camp. In preparation for this setup, you should download VirtualBox and Vagrant onto your personal machine. Windows users should additionally download Git Bash. 

The [prework](LINK) provides instructions for this setup. If you run into any issues, bring your questions to class and your instructor will assist you. 

### Preview This Week's Challenge

Each module in this course includes a Challenge homework assignment that youâ€™ll be able to complete by the end of the module using the knowledge you gained in class. Challenges are due one week after theyâ€™re assigned.  

For this moduleâ€™s Challenge, you will review three real-world cybersecurity reports and answer questions about each. 

### Looking Forward

The next module will cover governance, risk, and compliance&mdash;three fundamental concepts through which security teams instill strong security controls and a healthy security culture within organizations.

We will examine how a security team interacts with the larger business organization, and identify and prioritize attacks and vulnerabilities through risk management and threat modeling frameworks. We will also learn about various regulations and laws that inform the policies that security teams enforce.
