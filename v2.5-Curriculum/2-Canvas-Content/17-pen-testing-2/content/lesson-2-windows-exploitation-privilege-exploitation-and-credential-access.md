## Lesson 2: Windows Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, and Credential Access 
 
### Overview

Today, you'll expand upon the previous day's activities by leveraging the WMI module in Metasploit to gain a fully working reverse shell on the Windows machine. You will learn about Meterpreter, why it is a better reverse shell, and how its capabilities can help us in post exploitation. You will also perform privilege escalation via service abuse.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Generate payloads using `msfvenom`.

- Operate Meterpreter shells. 

- Perform and explain how process migration works.

### Today’s Activities

* **Windows Privilege Escalation**: In today's activities, you will continue to play the role of a pentester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne. In this activity, you will escalate your privileges on the Windows machine from tstark to SYSTEM privileges, giving you full control of the entire machine.

* **Windows Persistence**: Now that you have SYSTEM access over the machine, in this activity, you will establish persistence on it to ensure your SYSTEM access.
To do so, you will utilize Task Scheduler and create a scheduled task that will execute a custom Meterpreter payload.
