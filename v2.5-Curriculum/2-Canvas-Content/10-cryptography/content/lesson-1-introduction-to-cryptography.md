## Lesson 1: Introduction to Cryptography 
 
### Overview

Today's class will introduce the fundamental concepts of cryptography.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Use basic transcription and substitution ciphers and keys to encrypt simple messages.

- Understand how encryption supports secure communication through the PAIN framework.

- Differentiate between encoding and encrypting.

- Calculate the strength and efficiency of various encryption levels.

- Use the symmetric encryption tool Open SSL to confidentially transmit secure messages.

### Today’s Activities

* **Caesar Cipher Code Names**: In this activity, you'll apply basic cryptography by using a simple Caesar cipher to hide a message.

* **Decoding**: In this activity, you'll experience how character encoding can obfuscate a message and practice identifying encoding types.

* **Cryptography Concepts and Ciphers**: In this activity, you'll use a key to decrypt ciphertext and turn it into plaintext.

* **OpenSSL**: In this activity, you'll practice using a symmetric encryption tool, OpenSSL, to provide confidentiality when transmitting secure messages.
