# Module 10 Challenge

## Module 10 Challenge <assignment>

### Ransomware Riddles

> **Note:** The main part of this Challenge assignment reinforces the cryptography topics that we covered in class this week. However, the assignment also includes a Career Services reminder at the end&mdash;make sure to complete your milestones to become employer ready and employer competitive.

In this assignment, you will play the role of a cybersecurity analyst at Nakatomi Hospital.

- Unfortunately, one of the hospital's doctors opened an email containing ransomware.

- This ransomware spread throughout the hospital and encrypted all patient records.

- The ransomware has given you two options to decrypt and retrieve the patient records: either pay 100 Bitcoins or solve six riddles.

- Since you refuse to pay a ransom, you'll have to solve six cryptographic riddles. Act fast: the doctors need to access the patient records, as lives are at stake!

### Instructions

In order to solve the riddles, apply the cryptographic concepts that we've covered in the past three lessons.

- Once you've solved a riddle, submit your answer on the bottom of the Riddle page.

- If you have solved the riddle correctly, you will receive a **key**. Save this key in your M10 submission file.

- Once you have collected all six keys, select the Ransomware Decrypted header on the website, and enter all your keys.

- If all six keys are correct, the ransomware will be removed and the data will be decrypted. Take a screenshot of the decrypted data, and include this screenshot in your M10 submission file.


### Submission Guidelines

* After you complete your Submission File, including **all six keys** and **a screenshot** as proof that the ransomware has been decrypted, title it with the following format: < YOUR NAME >< Ransomware Riddles >
* Make sure to set the file permissions so that anyone can view and comment on your document.
* Submit the URL of your Submission File Google Doc through Canvas.

Good luck, and act fast&mdash;the Nakatomi patients are counting on you!
