# Module 10 Reflection

## Module 10 Reflection

Congratulations on completing Module 10 of the Cybersecurity boot camp! You are now able to:

- Use basic transcription and substitution ciphers and keys to encrypt simple messages.
- Understand how encryption supports secure communication through the PAIN framework.
- Differentiate between encoding and encrypting.
- Calculate the strength and efficiency of various encryption levels.
- Use the symmetric encryption tool Open SSL to confidentially transmit secure messages.
- Calculate the required number of symmetric and asymmetric keys based on the number of people exchanging secure messages.
- Use GPG to generate keys and encrypt and decrypt private messages.
- Use hashes to validate the integrity of data.
- Use digital signatures to validate the authenticity of data.
- Apply steganography in order to hide a message within non-secret data, such as an image.
- Use SSL certificates to help authenticate a website.
- Use cryptographic attack methods to crack a password.
- Use Hashcat to uncover the plaintext value of a hash.

Consult this week's student guides and slides for a refresher on the concepts that we covered this week, and take a few minutes to reflect on your learning:

What new topics did you learn in this module? How has your understanding changed or evolved? What are you wondering about? What questions do you have?

You will continue to build your knowledge and skills throughout the boot camp. Reach out to your instructor team with any outstanding questions about the content in this module.
