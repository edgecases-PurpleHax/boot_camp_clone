## Lesson 2: Asymmetric Encryption and Hashing 
 
### Overview

Today's class will expand on fundamental cryptography concepts, specifically covering asymmetric encryption and hashing.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Calculate the required number of symmetric and asymmetric keys based on the number of people exchanging secure messages.

- Use GPG to generate keys and encrypt and decrypt private messages.

- Use hashes to validate the integrity of data.

- Use digital signatures to validate the authenticity of data.

### Today’s Activities

* **Cryptography Refresher**: In this exercise, you'll review how to use Open SSL by exchanging encrypted messages with a partner.

* **Optimizing with Asymmetric Public Keys**: In this activity, you'll compare key distribution and the number of required keys for asymmetric and symmetric encryption.

* **GPG**: In this activity, you'll use GPG to generate public and private keys and encrypt and decrypt secret messages with the appropriate keys.

* **Generating Hashes**: In this exercise, you'll generate hashes to validate the integrity of data.

* **Digital Signatures**: In this activity, you'll validate signatures with GPG to determine authenticity.
