## Lesson 3: Applied Cryptography and Cryptographic Attacks 
 
### Overview

In today's class, we will explore how cryptographic concepts are applied to modern technology and security challenges.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Apply steganography in order to hide a message within non-secret data, such as an image.

- Use SSL certificates to help authenticate a website.

- Use cryptographic attack methods to crack a password.

- Use Hashcat to uncover the plaintext value of a hash.

### Today’s Activities

* **Cryptography Refresher**: In this activity, you'll get a refresher on all the cryptography topics that we've covered so far.

* **Steganography**: In this activity, you'll use steganography tools to determine whether an image holds any secret messages.

* **SSL Certificates**: In this activity, you'll check a website's SSL certificate to determine whether the site is authentic.

* **Cryptographic Attacks**: In this activity, you'll use a chosen-plaintext attack method to crack a password.

* **Hashcat**: In this activity, you'll use Hashcat to determine the plaintext value of a hash.
