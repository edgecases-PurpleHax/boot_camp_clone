## Lesson 1: Designing Your Defensive Solution 
 
### Overview

Today, you will work with your group to develop a defensive solution  in order to protect the mock organization. You will receive logs of “normal” business functions in order to understand the organization's environment. You will use these logs to create baselines and then design custom alerts, reports, and dashboards. You will additionally have the opportunity to download and use a Splunk "add-on" app of your choice to monitor against a type of attack.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today's class, you will:
 
- Load and analyze Windows logs.

- Create reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Windows logs.

- Load and analyze Apache logs.

- Create reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Apache logs.

- Install an add-on Splunk application for additional monitoring.
