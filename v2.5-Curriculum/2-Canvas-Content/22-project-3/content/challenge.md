# Project 3

## Project 3 <assignment>

### Building a Security Monitoring Environment

This week, you used Splunk to build a custom security monitoring environment for a fictional organization, tested that environment against simulated attacks, and presented your monitoring environment to the class. There is no additional Challenge assignment this week.

As you worked on Project 3 throughout the week, you should have completed the [Project 3 Review Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18JLq4dUf4zrL-6eqTNumXicpvpUDbHxPnZx2kOzwYoQ/edit?usp=sharing) and a [Project 3 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zekNOhsbKk-Jtmobsq9jslh1CYN-wlJDIOBFUC0Lb2s/edit?usp=sharing). These documents are your Project 3 deliverables. 

> **Note:** Make sure that your presentation includes the appropriate screenshots of your monitoring environment.

Although you worked on this project in a group, you must submit your deliverables individually. Follow the submission guidelines to submit your deliverables through Canvas.
