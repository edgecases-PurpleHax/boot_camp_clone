## Introduction to Module 22

### Project 3

This week, you will work in groups to use the skills that you've learned in the Defensive Security unit and design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization, VSI. On **Day 1**, you'll use Splunk to research and design a monitoring solution for the fictional organization. On **Day 2**, you'll determine whether that monitoring solution will protect the organization from several simulated attacks. On **Day 3**, you'll showcase your defensive project with a group presentation to the class.

### What to Be Aware Of

- Your final presentation will include screenshots of the monitoring environment that you design, so make sure to take screenshots as you work!

- Make sure that your group's presentation stays within the allotted time.
