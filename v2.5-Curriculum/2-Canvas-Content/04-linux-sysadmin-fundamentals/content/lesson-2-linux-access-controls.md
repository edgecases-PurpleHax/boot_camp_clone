## Lesson 2: Linux Access Controls 
 
### Overview

In today's class, we will continue our introduction to Linux by covering one of the operating system's most important functions: access control. You'll complete a sequence of activities that will expose you to many of the most fundamental aspects of Linux security: password strength, careful control of the `sudo` command, and file permissions.

The skills and tools that we'll cover today are essential for various professional roles, from systems administration to penetration testing.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Audit passwords using `john`.

- Elevate privileges with `sudo` and `su`.

- Create and manage users and groups.

### Today’s Activities

* **Talk to John**: In this activity, you will use `john`, which we installed in the previous class, to crack the password hashes for several users on a Linux system.

* **sudo Wrestling**: In this activity, you'll use the commands you've just learned to log in to a system as different users, check their `sudo` privileges, edit the `sudoers` file, and check for anything else suspicious.

* **Users and Group Activity**: In this activity, you will follow the principle of least privilege to make sure that the users on the system only have the access you want them to have and are only members of the correct groups.
