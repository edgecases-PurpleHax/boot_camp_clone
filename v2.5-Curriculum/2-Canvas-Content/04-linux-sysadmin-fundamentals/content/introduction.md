# Introduction to Module 4

## Introduction to Module 4

### Linux SysAdmin Fundamentals

This module introduces Linux operating systems and the basics of IT system administration. A strong knowledge of Linux is essential for many technical cybersecurity roles. Most computers that security professionals interact with are Linux computers, and much of a security professional's work involves configuring and networking them securely.

This module will prepare you for system administration roles by covering the foundational knowledge of users, groups, permissions, and access controls.

### What to Be Aware Of

You should regularly (at the end of each module) pull the latest Vagrant virtual machine builds, as detailed in the [Using Vagrant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Grxbagm-2jg22LiatDHzLDpJOsOl5JWJ9gl00TtiX6k/edit?usp=sharing) document.

### Security+ Domains

This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 2.0 Architecture and Design
- 3.0 Implementation

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: 
  - [Security+ Exam Objectives](https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia-security-sy0-601-exam-objectives-(2-0).pdf?sfvrsn=8c5889ff_2)

### This Week’s Lab Environment

In this module, you will use your local Vagrant virtual machine. Log in using the following credentials:

- Username: `sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`

### Preview This Week’s Challenge

In this week's Challenge assignment, you will prepare a Linux server for use by a fictional organization.

### Looking Forward

Next week, we will build on Linux sysadmin fundamentals by using Linux tools to archive and restore data. These practices maintain data availability and protect against natural disasters and cyberattacks. We will also learn how to schedule data backups on an hourly, daily, or monthly basis and monitor log files to prevent and detect suspicious activity.

You'll continue to use your local Vagrant VM for next week's activities. Don't forget to pull the latest Vagrant virtual machine build at the end of each module.
