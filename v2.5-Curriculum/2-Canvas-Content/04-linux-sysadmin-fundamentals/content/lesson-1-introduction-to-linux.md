## Lesson 1: Introduction to Linux 
 
### Overview

This week, you'll work through a series of command-line exercises in which you will explore a Linux file system, collect evidence of a security breach, audit and reconfigure a Linux machine's user and group permissions, and take steps to harden the system.

Today's class will introduce the Linux operating system.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Name three of the most important distributions of Linux.

- Navigate the Linux file structure by using the command line.

- Manage processes with the `top`, `ps`, and `kill` commands.

- Install packages by using `apt install`.

### Today’s Activities

* **Distribution Research**: In this exercise, you will play the role of a system administrator at an organization which has recently experienced a number of breaches involving servers running outdated Linux distributions. In response, the organization is upgrading the affected servers with newer distributions and versions of Linux. You will conduct research to determine which distribution is most appropriate for each machine.

* **Linux Landmarks**: In this exercise, you will explore a Linux file system using the command line.

* **Process Investigation**: In this activity, you will investigate all the processes running on a Linux file system to determine if there are any obvious processes that should not be running.
