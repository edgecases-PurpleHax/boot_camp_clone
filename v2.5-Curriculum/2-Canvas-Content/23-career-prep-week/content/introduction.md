## Introduction to Module 23

### Career Prep Week

In this module, we will focus on one of the most popular cybersecurity certifications: **Security+**. We will cover subject matter overviews, exam requirements, and test-taking strategies. On Day 2, we will explore some strategies for searching for IT security jobs and job networking. On Day 3, we'll focus on the interview process for cybersecurity jobs.

### What to Be Aware Of
