## Lesson 3: Load Balancing 
 
### Overview

Today's class will introduce the concept of load balancing in the cloud.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Write Ansible playbooks to configure VMs.

- Create a load balancer on the Azure platform.

- Create firewall and load balancer rules to allow traffic to the correct virtual machines.

### Today’s Activities

* **Ansible Playbooks**: In this activity, you will create an Ansible playbook that installs Docker and configures a VM with the DVWA web app.

* **Load Balancing**: In this activity, you will install a load balancer in front of the VM to distribute the traffic across more than one VM.

* **Security Configuration**: In this activity, you'll configure the load balancer and security group to work together to expose port `80` of the VM to your Home IP address.
