## Lesson 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing 
 
### Overview

Today's class begins the Cloud Security and Virtualization module. This class will introduce cloud computing service models, cloud networking, firewalls, and virtual computing. Over the next four classes, you will build a basic cloud network using VMs and containers.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Distinguish among cloud services and identify an appropriate service depending on an organization's needs.

- Set up a virtual private cloud network.

- Protect your cloud network with a firewall.

- Deploy a virtual computer to your cloud network.

### Today’s Activities

* **Virtual Networking**: In this activity, you will set up a resource group and a cloud network using the Azure Portal. 

* **Security Groups**: In this activity, you will create a network security group to control access to any resources in the subnet that you created in the last activity.

* **Virtual Computing**: In this activity, you will set up the first three virtual machines inside your cloud network, protected by your network security group. You will use one of these machines as a jump box to access your cloud network, and the other machines will be web servers.
