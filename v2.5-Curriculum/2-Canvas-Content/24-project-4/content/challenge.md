# Project 4

## Project 4 <assignment>

### bootCon Presentation

This week, you completed a project on a cybersecurity topic of your choosing and presented it to your class at the cyber class conference, bootCon. There is no additional Challenge assignment this week.

As you worked on Project 4 throughout the week, you should have completed a Google Slides deck that, at a minimum, includes the following:
* **Cover slide**: Presentation title and team member(s) presenting.
* **Technical background**:
    * Explanation of why you selected the topic that you are presenting.
    * Networking, cryptographic, or security concepts applied.
    * Research steps taken.
* **Demonstration preview**: Preview of the steps that you'll take in the upcoming demonstration.
* **Demonstration**: A live or recorded demonstration is conducted here.
* **Demonstration summary** : Summary of the demonstration that you just conducted and any impact that it may have.
* **Mitigation**: Recommendations for mitigating against the attack that you just conducted. If your presentation isn't about an attack, this is not required.

You will submit this deck through Canvas following the instructions below. Your Project 4 grade will be based partly upon this deck and partly upon your in-class presentation.

For further guidance on your bootCon presentation, refer back to the [bootCon Presentation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpdJfVxTdcix4RhuzrS5YcnZLHSTThM5Nzpfe0laU4s/edit?usp=sharing).
