### Project 4 - Interview Prep

Congratulations on completing your final project! 

As you know, career services is an integral part of your boot camp journey. In this module, we will focus on interviewing. If you are looking for a new role or hoping to interview internally for a promotion, it is important to understand how to prepare for the interview process. Additionally, it is critical to prepare and practice for each step in the interview process for cybersecurity roles.

### Navigating Interview Questions 

The goal of many cybersecurity interview questions is to assess your understanding of technical concepts, your cybersecurity acumen, and whether you can explain industry-specific concepts in a way that lay people can understand. 

Some positions require less technical know-how, while others have a strong focus on how well you can leverage technology. Cyber professionals who understand how to leverage technical tools and software will have more success relaying complicated details to engineers and non-technical colleagues. If you plan to work for a company where technical knowledge is highly valued across the board&mdash;think tech giants and tech-related startups&mdash;you should expect to receive more technical or technology-related questions during the interview process. 

Let's move through the steps of navigating cybersecurity technical questions by using the **IGotAnOffer Method**, a technical interview framework that can help you effectively communicate when answering technical interview questions. ([Source](https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/product-manager/technical-interview-questions)). 

**Step 1: Clarify your understanding of the question.**
* Jumping straight into answering a technical question to prove that you're knowledgeable isn’t always the most effective way to communicate clearly. Before starting to answer, make sure you:
    * Understand exactly what the interviewer wants you to explain. 
    * If needed, repeat the question and ask for clarification. This will help communicate your understanding or misunderstanding of the question to the interviewer.
* For broad questions, you will sometimes need to narrow down and focus your answer on the most important aspects of the question.

**Step 2: Explain in steps.**
* When you’re prepared to answer the question, structure your response in a step-by-step format in order to articulate your thoughts clearly. It’s completely okay to ask your interviewer for a few seconds to structure your thoughts before talking through your answer.

**Step 3: Wrap up.**
* Finally, summarize your answer. Especially when interviewing with large companies like Google, Apple, Bank of America, or AT&T, the interviewer may critique your answer, which is perfectly normal. They might even continue to ask probing questions to assess the depth of your understanding. 

#### Understanding the Mind of the Hiring Manager

Now that we know how to approach a technical interview question, let’s consider the context: What is the interviewer or hiring manager looking for? Understanding the psychology of the technical interview can give job candidates a distinct advantage. When asking technical interview questions, interviewers are often looking for: 

* Effective communication	
    * Are you able to effectively communicate with cybersecurity professionals as well as stakeholders without technical expertise?
    * Often, the interviewer doesn’t expect you to be an expert in a particular technology; instead, they want to know whether you understand the field enough to talk about the relevant technology and tools in a clear and accurate way. 
    * Are you able to speak their language? You don’t necessarily need to know code, but it's important that you can speak in terms of user interfaces, functionality, and so on, to show that you know what code is and/or how it applies to the job. 
* Implications of technical decisions
    * Do you understand how another team's actions or suggestions will directly or indirectly impact your team? In other words, if the engineering team decides to do X, do you understand the impact that will have on your work? Will there be a change to the network in the near or distant future? What might you need to anticipate when working with other teams?  
* Building trust 
    * Relationship management is a big part of any cybersecurity role. How you collaborate and engage with other teams is an important part of building trust. This is another reason why being able to speak their language is so valuable. 
    * Can you work with the relevant teams day to day to help solve problems, or will you be dismissive of their ideas?

#### Practice, Practice, Practice! 

Mock interviews are an important preparation step. They allow you to practice for a job interview and then receive feedback from a career coach, industry professional, or peer. 

During your course, you’ll have an opportunity to practice mock interviews, answering on-the-spot interview questions related to cybersecurity. The interviewer will ask questions that are typical of behavioral and technical interviews. They will also provide feedback at the end of the mock interview. 

Here are a couple of mock interview avenues you can take advantage of:

* You may schedule time to meet with your Career Coach (CC) after you have completed an employer-ready resume.

    * Work one-on-one with your CC to develop solid interview strategies, improve your communication skills, and practice, practice, practice!
    * Your CC can provide you with tips on how to alleviate the stress and anxiety people often feel when interviewing.
    * In today’s job market, interviews are often conducted virtually. Your CC can also provide feedback on your body language, eye contact, and interview attire in a virtual environment. 

* You can use the interview questions on [Edureka](https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/cybersecurity-interview-questions/) to practice interviewing with your cybersecurity peers and industry professionals.

The more you practice, the better prepared you’ll be for a real interview.
