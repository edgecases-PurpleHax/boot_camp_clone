## Module 24 Reflection

Congratulations on completing your final project and the entire Cybersecurity boot camp! 

During the course of this boot camp, you learned about foundational security, networking, and cloud topics; offensive security; defensive security; and many aspects of the cybersecurity profession and career possibilities. You completed four cybersecurity projects, including a final project that you researched and presented just like cybersecurity professionals do at industry conferences.

But as you graduate from this course, your cybersecurity journey is just beginning. As you take your next steps, remember that you can always consult your class materials, career services resources, and professional network for support and guidance. Good luck!
