# Introduction to Module 12

## Introduction to Module 12

### Web Development

In this module, we will learn about web application architecture and the web client-server model HTTP communication process.

- On Day 1, we will cover the HTTP communication process and explore how sessions are managed by web applications using cookies.

- On Day 2, we will cover modern web application architecture, web application software "stacks," how to deploy web application container sets, and how to create SQL queries to manage data in databases.

### What to Be Aware Of

This week's Challenge assignment includes an optional bonus activity that requires you to have completed the `curl` and swapping sessions activities from Day 1 of this module.

### Security+ Domains

This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities 
- 2.0 Architecture and Design 
- 3.0 Implementation

### This Week’s Lab Environment

You will continue to use your local Vagrant virtual machine for this module's activities.

- Log in with the following credentials:
  
  - Username: `sysadmin`
  - Password: `cybersecurity`

### Preview This Week’s Challenge

In this week's Challenge, you'll demonstrate your understanding of the web client-server model HTTP communication process.

### Looking Forward

In the next module we'll explore cloud security and virtualization, and then you'll start your first project of the course!
