## Lesson 2: Microservices and Web Application Architecture 
 
### Overview

In the last class, we examined how the HTTP request and response communication framework relays information between a web server and client. We also learned how web servers and clients use cookies to establish sessions.

Today, we'll explore the web application infrastructure that makes the web client-server model possible. Specifically, we will cover:
- Why the original paradigm of monolith web application architecture evolved to the microservices model.
- The different components of web applications.
- Specific examples of web application components, or **stacks**.
- The deployment of web application architecture.
- The database component of web applications and how to interact with data.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Understand how microservice architecture delivers more robust, reliable, and repeatable infrastructure as code.

- Define the different services within a LEMP stack.

- Deploy a Docker Compose container set and test the deployment's functionality.

- Describe how relational databases store and retrieve data.

- Create SQL queries to view, enter, and delete data.

### Today’s Activities

* **Monolith to Microservices**: In this activity, you'll design a microservices setup based on a fictional company's current monolithic web store app diagram.

* **Deploying and Testing a Container Set**: In this activity, you'll use Docker Compose to deploy a container set and confirm functionality.

* **Databases Management**: In this activity, you'll locally deploy a fictional company's employee directory website with Docker Compose, and you'll manage the data inside of the employee directory database.
