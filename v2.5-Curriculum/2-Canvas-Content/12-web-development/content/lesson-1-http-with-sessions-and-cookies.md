## Lesson 1: HTTP with Sessions and Cookies 
 
### Overview

Today's class will introduce HTTP through the web client-server model and explore web application session management through cookies.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Understand HTTP requests and responses. 

- Use the `curl` command-line tool to make GET and POST requests and examine the responses.

- Manage cookies using the Chrome extension Cookie-Editor.

- Use Chrome's Developer Tools to audit HTTP request and response headers.

### Today’s Activities

* **HTTP Requests and Responses**: In this activity, you'll combine your research and critical thinking skills to investigate the HTTP sequences of a web attack that occurred on a company's servers.

* **Inspecting with Developer Tools**: In this activity, you'll use your browser's developer tools to examine HTTP requests and responses, particularly security headers.

* **Using `curl`**: In this activity, you'll write `curl` commands to interact with an HTTP web server. You will use various `curl` options, request methods, and request headers to return specific responses.

* **Swapping Sessions**: In this activity, you'll use the Chrome browser extension Cookie-Editor with a fictional company's WordPress site to examine the process an attacker might take to hijack a session.
