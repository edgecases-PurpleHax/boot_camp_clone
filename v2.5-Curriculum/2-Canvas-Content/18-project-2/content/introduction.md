# Introduction to Module 18

## Introduction to Module 18

### Project 2

In this second project week, you will use the skills that you've learned in the Offensive Security unit to attack the fictional organization Rekall Corporation and determine its vulnerabilities. 

On **Day 1**, you'll attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on the organization's web application. On **Day 2**, you'll exploit the organization's Linux servers, and on **Day 3**, you'll exploit the organization's Windows servers. 

The project is structured as a Capture the Flag (CTF) style competition, so that each vulnerability that you exploit correlates with a "flag," and flags are worth various point amounts depending on the difficulty level of the exploit.

You will summarize your findings and recommended mitigations in a penetration testing summary report. A framework for the report will be provided. This report will be your final project deliverable.

### What to Be Aware Of

* Take screenshots of your vulnerability findings throughout the project, as you will need to include these screenshots in your final report.

* :warning: **Important**: While this is a group activity, and findings can be shared amongst group members, **every student is required to submit their own report deliverable** in order to receive credit for Project 2!
