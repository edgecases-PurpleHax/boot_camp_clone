### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you will:
 
* Find flags by exploiting vulnerabilities in a fictional organization's Windows servers.

### Today’s Activities

* **Exploiting Windows Servers**: In today's portion of Project 2, you are tasked with finding all vulnerabilities in Rekall's Windows servers. As in Day 1 and 2's activities, you are also tasked with finding "flags" by exploiting these vulnerabilities.

    * Use the [Day 3 Activity Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jP26cNPWwgZJtTz3yOt_y1KLJ4ryOx5KCO7CU36rWbI/edit?usp=sharing) to complete today's tasks.

    * As you work, remember to take screenshots of your vulnerability findings and to update your penetration testing summary report.
