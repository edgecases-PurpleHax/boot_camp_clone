## Lesson 1: Web Application CTF 
 
### Overview

Today, you'll begin your second project. In this project, you'll use the skills that you learned in the Offensive Security unit to attack a fictional organization, Rekall Corporation, and determine its vulnerabilities. As you do so, you will look for "flags" within the organization's web application and operating systems that you'll collect in a competition-style Capture the Flag (CTF) game. Today, you will attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the organization's web application. 
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you will:
 
* Find flags by exploiting vulnerabilities in a fictional organization's web application.

### Today’s Activities

* **Attacking the Web Application**: In today's portion of Project 2, you are tasked with finding all vulnerabilities in Rekall's new web application. Fifteen "flags" are hidden across the web application, and a flag will display once you successfully exploit a vulnerability. 

    * Use the [Day 1 Activity Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBzHudN8MN8Gcjmjk69YnO9A-Zbhu2EjAgTvyQtX8VA/edit?usp=sharing) to complete today's tasks.

    * As you work, remember to take screenshots of your vulnerability findings and to update your penetration testing summary report. You can use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kz1sOwmb82uNXJyZlox9cP7tPvDpNNcvkxREuCFBVLM/edit?usp=sharing) for your report (remember to make a copy first!).
