## Lesson 1: Introduction to Networking 
 
### Overview

Today's class begins our introduction to networking. You'll learn about the client-server model and use this knowledge to assess given scenarios and identify clients, servers, requests, and responses. You'll also learn about network topology and network devices, and you'll use your new skills to map your own network using the web tool Gliffy.

After studying these foundational networking concepts, we'll turn to network IP addressing, private and public IP addresses, and subnetting. We'll conclude class by covering similar concepts as they apply to the internet, including DNS, URLs, and their security implications.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Identify clients, servers, requests, and responses in network communications.

- Identify network topologies and compare their advantages and disadvantages.

- Design a conceptual network made of various network and network security devices.

- Convert binary numeric representations to readable IP addresses and determine which servers the IP addresses belong to.

- Modify Host files to circumvent DNS and redirect the access of a website.

### Today’s Activities

* **Network Security**: In the exercise, you'll practice identifying pieces of the client-server architecture using specific examples involving a business's network security.

* **Network Devices**: In this activity, you'll use your knowledge of network devices to set up a network design. Additionally, you'll implement network security devices, with a focus on how their placement affects the protection of an organization's resources.

* **Network Addressing**: In this exercise, you'll convert binary traffic into an IP address, determine if it is a public or private address, and compare the IP to a list of servers to see which system a malicious hacker is trying to access.

* **DNS Hijacking Activity**: In this exercise, you'll create and test a DNS spoof record that will redirect any hacker trying to visit a certain website to another site.
