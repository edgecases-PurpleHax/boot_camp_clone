## Lesson 2: Ports, Protocols, and the OSI Model 
 
### Overview

Today's class is the second part of our introduction to networking. We'll learn about **protocols** and **ports**, and then we'll use this knowledge to analyze a suspicious employee's traffic log. We'll explore how protocols work together by studying the **OSI model** and use what we learn to identify the source of various network problems.

After studying these foundational networking concepts, we will also learn how to use Wireshark to create and analyze live traffic captures. We'll finish class by analyzing a capture file taken on a rogue employee's computer to determine exactly what they were doing and who they were communicating with.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Interpret data in network packets by analyzing their headers, payloads, and trailers.

- Explain the role of ports in specifying a network packet's destination.

- Associate common protocols with their assigned ports.

- Explain how encapsulation and decapsulation allow different protocols to interact with one another.

- Use the layers of the OSI model to identify sources of problems on a network.

- Capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark.

### Today’s Activities

* **Interpreting Protocols**: In this activity, you will analyze several logs of recent network activity, convert raw binary data into a readable format, and determine which protocol is being used.

* **Ports**: In this activity, you will analyze several network requests and determine the source and destination port for each request as well as the protocol for each destination port. You will then research the protocol to determine what kind of activities might have been conducted.

* **OSI Layers**: In this activity, you'll review a list of several suspicious network-related activities and document at which OSI layer each occurred.

* **Capturing Packets Activity**: For this activity, you'll configure your Wireshark application with five specific configuration settings.

* **Analyzing HTTP Data Activity**: In this activity, you'll analyze web traffic to determine what websites and webpages a specific account has accessed. You will also interrogate logs to see if this account is sending any communications.
