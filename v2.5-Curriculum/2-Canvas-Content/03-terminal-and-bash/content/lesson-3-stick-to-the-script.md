## Lesson 3: Stick to the Script 
 
### Overview

In today's class, you'll further develop your command-line skills by learning how to use text processing and text editing to develop your own `cd log_directory` line script.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:

- Define three benefits of text processing programs over programming languages for a security professional.

- Use `sed` to make substitutions to a file.

- Use `awk` to isolate data points from a complex log file.

- Edit contents of a file using `nano`.

- Design an IP lookup shell script by passing arguments.

### Today’s Activities

* **Warm-Up**: In this exercise, you'll practice using some of the terminal commands that we learned in previous classes.

* **Using sed**: In this activity, you'll practice using the text processing capability of `sed` to replace data and make data consistent.

* **Using awk**: In this activity, you'll practice using the `awk` command to isolate certain fields from complex files.

* **My First Shell Script**: In this activity, you'll use shell scripts to assist with running several commands by running one single command.

* **Building an IP Lookup Tool**: In this activity, you'll design a script that can look up the country associated with an IP address in a log file. You'll use many of the terminal commands that you've learned this week to accomplish this task.
