## Lesson 1: Advanced Bash 
 
### Overview

In today's class, you will combine commands, create custom commands, and begin writing bash scripts. 

Over the next two classes, you'll use these skills to collect evidence, audit and reconfigure a Linux machine, and take steps to harden the system. 
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Construct compound commands using `&&`, `|`, and file redirects.

- Create and save alias commands to your `~/.bashrc` file.

- Edit `$PATH` variables to include a custom `~/scripts` directory.

- Create simple bash scripts composed of a list of commands.

### Today’s Activities

* **Compound Commands**: In this activity, you will try to simplify the job of auditing a new system with automation. You will begin by combining several commands to make fewer overall commands.

* **Creating Aliases**: In this activity, you will create custom commands using aliases and the `~/.bashrc` file.

* **My First Bash Script**: In this activity, you will put your commands into a script file and run your first basic script using `./` notation.

* **Custom Commands**: In this activity, you will turn your script into a custom command and add a script directory to the `$PATH` so that you can call your script directly on the command line from any directory.
