## Lesson 2: Ifs and Lists (Bash Scripting Continued) 
 
### Overview

In today's class, we'll expand on our bash scripting skills to collect logs, audit and reconfigure a Linux machine, and take steps to harden the system.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Read bash and interpret scripts.

- Use variables in your bash scripts.

- Use `if` statements in your bash scripts.

- Use lists in your bash scripts.

- Iterate through lists with a `for` loop to do useful things like install a list of packages.

### Today’s Activities

* **Variables and if Statements**: In this activity, you will add variables and conditional `if` statements to a bash script.

* **Lists and Loops**: In this activity, you will use loops to automate repetitive tasks. You'll create several `for` loops that satisfy given requirements, and if you get to the bonus task, you'll incorporate a `for` loop into your script.
