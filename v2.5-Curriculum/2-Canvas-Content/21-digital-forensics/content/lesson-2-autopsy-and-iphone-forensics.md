## Lesson 2: Autopsy and iPhone Forensics 
 
### Overview

In the second day of our digital forensics module, you'll use Autopsy to analyze an iPhone image.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Identify the methods used in smartphone forensics investigations.

- Navigate the database and file structure of the iPhone's flash drive.

- Locate identifiable evidence on the iPhone in order to establish ownership.

- Use Autopsy to view and tag evidence in an iPhone image.

- Extract image content for offline viewing in other applications (logs, text, pictures, video, audio).

### Today’s Activities

* **Mobile Evidence Analysis**: In this activity, you will analyze evidence and create a spreadsheet that profiles the details of Tracy's iPhone. This will serve as your preliminary documentation for the remaining activities.

* **Tagging Evidence**: In this activity, you will tag the major databases and files in the iPhone image file. You will create new tags for evidence that's relevant to the case, such as mail, address book, and SMS.

* **Extracting Data for Offline Analysis**: In this activity, you will create export files for offline examination, so the investigative team can identify and confirm Tracy's phone number.
