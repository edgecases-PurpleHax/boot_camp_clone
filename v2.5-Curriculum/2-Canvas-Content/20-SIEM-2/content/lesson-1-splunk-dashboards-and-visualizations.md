## Lesson 1: Splunk Dashboards and Visualizations 
 
### Overview

In today's class, we will create dashboards that display useful visualizations of our Splunk searches. In this week's activities, you will continue to play the role of SOC manager at Omni Military Products (OMP).
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll be able to:
 
- Create visualizations of single and multiple value searches. 

- Use the `geostats` and `iplocation` commands to add location-based visualizations to searches. 

- Combine multiple visualizations in a single dashboard. 

- Modify dashboards with time range input and drilldown capabilities.

### Today’s Activities

* **Single Value Visualization**: In this activity, you will design a radial gauge to assist in monitoring attacks against OMP's website.

* **Multiple Value Visualization**: In this activity, you will design a multiple value visualization to display the URL paths being targeted by the POST requests.

* **Geographic Map Visualization**: In this activity, you will design a geographic map visualization to help your SOC team understand where attacks are originating, so that they can create firewall rules that restrict traffic from certain geographic locations.

* **Creating Dashboards**: In this activity, you will design a dashboard where your team can view the radial gauge, pie chart, and geographic map in a single location.

* **Advanced Dashboards**: In this activity, you will enhance your dashboard by adding drilldowns and interactivity features.
