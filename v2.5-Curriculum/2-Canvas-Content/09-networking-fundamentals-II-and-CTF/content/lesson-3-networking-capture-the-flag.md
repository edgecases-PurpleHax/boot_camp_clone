## Lesson 3: Networking Capture the Flag 
 
### Overview

Today, you'll compete in a Capture the Flag activity that will test many of the networking skills and tools you've learned so far.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
By the end of today’s class, you’ll have a firmer command of all the networking skills that we've covered over the past two modules.

### Today’s Activities

* **The CTF Competition**: In this CTF, you'll be provided a spreadsheet of various networking questions and activities that are separated into different networking categories.

The answers to questions and activities are the flags that you must collect. Each flag has a different numeric point value. The higher the point value, the more challenging the question/activity. The student who completes all the flags correctly first, or who has the most points at the end of class, will win the CTF.
