# Introduction to Module 9

## Introduction to Module 9

### Networking Fundamentals II and CTF

In the second networking fundamentals module, we will build on the skills that we learned in the first week, covering more advanced concepts such as DHCP, NAT, routing, wireless technology, DNS records, and email networking. This week will conclude with a fun Capture the Flag (CTF) competition where you'll use the skills you've learned over the past two weeks. 

### What to Be Aware Of

- On Day 2, during the DNS Record Types activity, we will make DNS requests. Note that your specific results may vary from the examples provided in the lesson plan and student guide. 

- On Day 3, we will compete in a Capture the Flag activity. CTF events are popular exercises used throughout IT and cybersecurity training.

### Security+ Domains

This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

- 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities 
- 2.0 Architecture and Design 
- 3.0 Implementation

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource:

### This Week’s Lab Environment

You will continue to use your local Vagrant virtual machine for today's activities.  

- Username:`sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`

### Preview This Week’s Challenge

In this week's Challenge assignment, you will review network issues, examine DNS records to determine the cause of the issues, and recommend fixes for each.

### Looking Forward

Next week, we will explore a completely different topic: cryptography. Cryptography is the art and science of keeping information secure by using mathematical concepts and techniques.
