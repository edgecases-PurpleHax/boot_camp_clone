## Online Classroom Strategies 

This document includes strategies for online teaching. It uses the in-line callouts (usually indicated by this icon: 🌐) that you will find in the lesson plans next to specific tips for online classroom delivery. 

### General Online Teaching Strategies 
Below are some general online strategies we recommend you use and adapt as needed for your class.

🌐 **Communicate using Slack.** Create Slack channels for your class to ask questions during Instructor Dos and activities. Slack is an extremely important communication channel in the online teaching environment. You may have already created custom Slack channels. You can create additional channels to help manage the classroom and provide ongoing support to students during class time.

- At a minimum, you should have a #ClassQuestions channel, but you can also create separate channels for different portions of the class, e.g., #ClassInstructorDo and #ClassActivities. 

- We recommend that you disable Zoom chat and only use Slack for communications, as it’s more flexible. 

🌐 **Encourage students to leave cameras on.** Do the best you can to encourage students to share their video during the class. If students feel uncomfortable sharing their home backgrounds, suggest using custom backgrounds. [More info on custom backgrounds here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/204674889-Zoom-Rooms-Customized-Background#:~:text=Log%20in%20to%20the%20Zoom,Rooms%2C%20click%20Upload%20New%20Image.).

🌐 **Engage the class during transitions.** You can lose the class’s focus in the time it takes to open a new tab or switch between class resources. Stay engaged while transitioning between screens.

- Narrating what you are doing during transitions eases students’ feelings of uncertainty and fills awkward silences. Here are some examples of what you can say during common transitions:
    - **From sharing the slideshow to Zoom gallery view:** “I’m going to stop sharing my screen for a moment while we review this activity.”

    - **From sharing the slideshow to sharing a tab on your browser:** “Bear with me as I switch over to my browser for the next demonstration.”

📊: **Check comprehension with class polls.** We recommend performing frequent comprehension checks throughout class. At a minimum, do this at the end of every Instructor Do and activity review. Class polls provide students with an opportunity to *anonymously* indicate how well they understood the previous activity.

- TAs should note which students indicate during a poll that they need more help. The instructional team should engage these students individually and create a strategy to help address the student's needs, e.g., extra reading assignments, tutoring, extra activities, etc.

- Use the feedback from polls to adjust your pace for the rest of class or recommend that students who need a more in-depth review attend office hours.

- You can use the [Zoom polling](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-Meetings) feature, [Slack polling](https://slack.com/help/articles/229002507-Create-a-poll-) feature, or a separate tool like  [Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/). Remember that you can prepare polls before class on all these platforms. 

Use the following as an example:  

- Question: How comfortable do you feel with [topic]?

- Answers:

    - I feel great! Ready to move on!
    - I’m a little confused.
    - Help!

🌐 **Use breakout rooms for activities.** Create breakout rooms for all group activities. Convert Partner Dos (pair activities) into group activities. Even though students must work on most activities individually due to the constraints of individual lab environments, we still recommend you create breakout rooms so that students can spend time in more intimate environments for portions of the class. This will help foster connections and community in the classroom. It will also encourage students to work with one another and learn valuable collaboration skills. 

- If you’ve made one of the TAs a co-host of the webinar, they should create breakout rooms of five to six students while you describe activities. [Follow these instructions to pre-assign breakout rooms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LxiakaFMQ7FlnhcbgnZvW7bCqGBeDx1SJgZ8qMWVLAg/edit?usp=sharing).

- We recommend that you make sure there is at least one strong student in each breakout group.

- Make sure you and the TAs jump in and out of breakout rooms to answer questions and provide feedback. 
  
    - Doing this is both an opportunity to offer encouragement, and a chance to confirm that students are working in the right direction. 

    - We recommend you reserve one breakout room for instructional staff. Coordinate with your TAs to know which rooms need more assistance, or which have recently been helped, by using the private instructional channel in your class Slack workspace or the staff breakout room.

    - **Important:** Remember that if the host is recording locally, your recording will capture the room the host is in. If the host is recording to the cloud, it will record only the main room. Ensure any private conversations on student progress are not recorded.

    - Before everyone goes into their breakout rooms, remind students and the instructional staff that questions on Slack are welcome and will be monitored. It's a good way for the instructional team to prioritize students who need extra help while circulating through rooms.

- Broadcast major announcements or time warnings at the mid-way point and two minutes before the end of the activity to keep students on pace and to help them finish on time.

    - For major announcements, a member of the instructional staff should join each breakout room to ensure that the message was received. 

    - To broadcast an announcement to breakout rooms: 
        - Click **Breakout Rooms** in the meeting controls. 
        - Click **Broadcast a message to all**, enter your message and click **Broadcast**.
        - The message will now appear for all participants in breakout rooms.

🌐 **Use the main room for individual activities.** If an activity is best done individually, you don’t need to create breakout rooms. Instead, make sure the whole class is muted and switch to Zoom gallery view so you can monitor students as they work. 

🌐 **Facilitating classroom questions during activities.**  Tell students that if they have a question, they should share it on the #ClassActivities Slack channel and a member of the instructional staff will respond. If a student has a question that is relevant to the whole class, the instructor and TA should communicate it to everyone. 

🌐 **Facilitating discussions.** Follow these steps to get the conversation going:

1. Stop sharing your screen and switch to [gallery view](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000005883-Displaying-participants-in-gallery-view) in Zoom to see your class on one screen. You can find this option in the top-right corner of Zoom.
2. Ask students to raise their hands to ask a question or pose an idea by clicking **Raise Hand** in the webinar controls.
3. To see which students are raising their hands, click **Participants** in the meeting controls. Then click the **Attendees** tab.
4. Hover over a participant with their hand raised for these options:

    - Allow to talk: Allow the participant to talk and unmute their mic. The participant will receive a prompt to confirm if they want to unmute or stay muted. If you've already allowed a participant to talk but they decided to stay muted, click **Unmute** to prompt them to unmute their mic.
    - Disable talking: If you allow a participant to talk, this function will remove their ability to talk. The participant will stay muted.
    - Lower hand: Lower the participant's hand. Their position in queue will move below the participants with their hands raised.
    - Click **Lower All Hands** at the bottom of the participants list to lower all raised hands.


🌐 **Use Zoom tools to enhance demos and presentations.** Consider using tools like the [whiteboard](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard) and [annotation functions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005706806-Using-annotation-tools-on-a-shared-screen-or-whiteboard) to more easily and interactively explain concepts. In our lesson plans, we’ll note where these tools may be helpful. If you plan to use these tools, make sure to practice before class.

The following sections offer tips for managing specific class sections and scenarios in the online teaching environment. 

### Instructor Dos 

🌐  For particularly long Instructor Dos, break them up with questions and discussions. Stop sharing your screen and revert to Zoom gallery view. These breaks from the slides allow students to see each other’s faces and help foster connection and a sense of community, which can often be lacking in a virtual class environment. 

🌐  During complicated presentations or slides, you can switch to [Zoom’s whiteboard features](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard) to draw or make notes to better explain concepts. The whiteboard feature allows you to freely draw out concepts, such as wiring or networking diagrams. This my require a tablet and pencil.  


🌐 During instructor demonstrations and reviews where you are sharing your screen, ask students to use the [Zoom annotate](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005706806-Using-annotation-tools-on-a-shared-screen-or-whiteboard) feature to pinpoint where they see errors. They can find this tool near the top of the shared screen display by clicking **View Options** > **Annotate**. They can use stamps, write text, or draw.
- When you are done with the annotations, navigate to the **Annotation** tools and select **Clear** to remove all annotations.

🌐 For Instructor Dos that contain demo and discussion, stop sharing your screen when asking questions, and switch to Zoom gallery view. Begin sharing your screen again when you’re ready to restart the demo. 

🌐 For questions to which you want students to type (rather than speak) their answers, tell them to share their answers in the Zoom chat or Slack.

🌐 For questions to which you want students to speak (rather than type) their answers, call on a specific student to unmute to answer a question. Students may be hesitant to unmute and call out answers to questions if you don't do this. 

- Alternatively, students may all come off mute and speak at once. This could cause confusion. Ask students to raise their hands to ask a question or pose an idea by clicking **Raise Hand** in the webinar controls.

### Student Dos 

🌐 Sometimes you will want to preview the activity for students, particularly in early activities. In this case, share the activity file instructions on the screen. Read through the activity and make sure students understand what they’re supposed to do.

- Stop sharing your screen and switch to gallery view in Zoom to see your class on one screen. 

- Ask the class to use the Zoom meeting reactions found in the control panel at the bottom of the Zoom window. They can use the thumbs up 👍 or thumbs down :thumbsdown: emojis to demonstrate if they're feeling comfortable and confident with the activity. 

- Switch back to the activity file instructions on your screen to clarify anything.

- You can also share your screen to demonstrate the first steps for solving the activity if students are feeling particularly stuck or confused.

### Reviews 

🌐 Ask students to use the raise hand feature on Zoom to answer “yes” to questions. Alternatively, you can have students turn their video functions off to reflect a “no” answer.

🌐 Sometimes you may prefer written responses, especially if there are a lot of questions to get through or if you are short on time. This is also helpful if it’s important or easier for you to keep your screen shared. In this case, tell students to share their answers in the Zoom chat or Slack.

🌐 Sometimes you may prefer to hear responses out loud, especially during discussions or activities that are foundational or have important takeaways. 

  - Students may be hesitant to come off mute and call out answers questions. Call on specific students to unmute and answer a question.

   - Alternatively, students may all come off mute and speak at once. This could cause confusion. Ask your students to raise their hands to ask a question or pose an idea.

🌐 When asking questions during review walkthroughs, stop sharing your screen and switch to gallery view as students offer their answers, either aloud or via Zoom or Slack chat. Questions can be yes/no or open-ended, but the goal is to check for comprehension and maintain engagement. These breaks where students can see each other's faces helps foster community. 

- Begin sharing your screen again to resume the review. 

🌐 Sometimes you will want students to share their screens during a review. Remind the student sharing their screen to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before doing so.

🌐 You can also have individual students share their screens simultaneously. If multiple students are sharing their screens, the instructor can move between students at random, holding everyone accountable and focused during reviews. [Find more details on setting up multiple screen sharing here.](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000424286-Sharing-Multiple-Screens-Simultaneously)  

### Projects 

🌐 Even though students are working in their own lab environments and must complete projects individually, let students know that maintaining ongoing communication with their project group is important. It's one way to ensure everyone is collaborating effectively, helping each other through tough problems, and asking one another for help. Some ways groups can keep up communication include:
- When in breakout rooms, students should keep their cameras on to help facilitate discussion and connection.
- Even when working individually, students should remain in breakout rooms with their cameras on. 
- Muting is okay to filter out background noise, but encourage students to frequently unmute to share ideas and ask questions.

🌐 During project week, be sure to check your #ClassActivities Slack channel for questions while students are in breakout rooms. Also, make sure you and the TAs jump in and out of breakout rooms to address questions and provide feedback.
- Remember to broadcast a two-minute warning to breakout rooms to help students wrap up work sessions.

🌐 During project week, bring all students back to the main room before going on break to check on progress and answer questions.

#### Project Presentations 
🌐 Since students can’t physically come to the front of the class to demonstrate, tell groups that they will be made co-hosts during their presentation and critique times. 

🌐 Encourage students to practice presentations before they present to the class. You and TAs can use office hours for presentation practice. Use breakout groups so that different groups can simultaneously practice their presentations. 

🌐 Students should select a group member to share their screen, and control slides and other presentation materials. Once they finish presenting, ask them to stop sharing and return to gallery view, and use the raise hand feature to manage questions and critiques.

🌐 Prior to presentation day, Slack out instructions for controlling the raise hand feature:
- To see who is raising their hand, click **Participants** in the meeting controls, then click the **Attendees** tab.
- Hover over a participant with their hand raised for these options:
    - Allow to talk: Allow the participant to talk and unmute their mic. The participant will receive a prompt asking if they want to unmute or stay muted. If you've already allowed a participant to talk, but they decided to stay muted, click **Unmute** to prompt them to unmute their mic.
    - Disable talking: If you’ve allowed a participant to talk, this function will remove that ability. The participant will stay muted.
    - Lower hand: Lower a participant's hand. Their position in queue will move below participants with their hands raised.
        - Click **Lower All Hands** at the bottom of the participants list to lower all raised hands.

🌐 Ask a TA to adjust host controls for each group at the beginning and end of their presentation using these [enabling a co-host instructions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206330935-Enabling-and-adding-a-co-host#:~:text=Click%20on%20Manage%20Participants%20in,Click%20Make%20Co%2DHost). To enable smooth transitions between teams, the TA should have a list of all team members and the order of group presentations prior to the first presentation.
- Before the first group begins, remind students to mute notifications and close any screens that may contain private information before sharing their screen and while presenting.

- At the end of a critique period, a TA should remove the current group from co-host control and provide the next group with co-host control.

🌐 After the last presentation, remove any student co-hosts, and finish the class in gallery view.


### Homework

🌐 When announcing homework, always remind students to leave enough time to complete it. 

- Right now, with most people stuck at home, the days can feel like they all blend together. As a result, students may not realize that they’re getting closer to the due date of an assignment.

- Deliberately scheduling time throughout the week for coursework will help. Tell students to set aside three hours, three to four times per week for studying and homework. The coursework won’t feel as overwhelming this way, and students won’t be working on assignments last minute!
