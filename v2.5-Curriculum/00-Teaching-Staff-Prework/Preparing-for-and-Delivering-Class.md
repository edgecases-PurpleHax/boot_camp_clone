## Preparing for and Delivering Class 

We're excited to have you as part of our cybersecurity instructional and teaching staff!

So far, you've completed the Instructor Onboarding course on Canvas, which oriented you to our program and teaching approach. The Instructor/TA resources in this repo will give you specific cybersecurity teaching tips, as well as an in-depth look at the technical lab solutions used to deliver the majority of this program.

### Overview
This boot camp is a fast-paced 24-week program that dives into networking and a variety of cybersecurity topics. While this is a very technical course, the majority of  students have little or no prior technical experience. The course begins with an introduction to security, security thinking, and organizational concerns. Following that, we quickly build students' technical skills, beginning with several weeks on systems administration. This leads into networks, cryptography, and network security. We then dive into more specific security topics, including cloud security, web vulnerabilities, penetration testing, SIEM, and forensics.

#### Things to Note

* This will be a challenging course for students, especially those who are complete beginners.
  * While we've carefully designed our curriculum to include review days, we recommend that you adjust the pace of the course accordingly if you find that your students are having difficulty keeping up.

* If you are not able to cover every topic in a unit, that's okay! Prioritize important topics and update the homework accordingly.

* Shape the curriculum to best fit your students' needs. We pack a lot of details and narrative into our lesson plans, but you are free to adjust accordingly.
 
    * For example, if a thorough instructor review isn't required for an activity, feel free to briefly summarize the main points of the activity and move on.

    * Spend extra time on foundational concepts, and if necessary, leave out more complicated nuance, especially if it is not required for students to complete subsequent activities.


### Preparing For Class

* **Lesson plans and student activities**. Expect to spend 2-3 hours preparing for each class. Read through the entire lesson plan and run through all activities to ensure that everything is working prior to class start. This will help eliminate any issues during class. 

  * Instructional staff must review all instructor demos and student activities prior to class. 
    * To reduce prep time, TAs can run through student activities, while instructors review just the instructor demos.
  * Make sure to thoroughly read all Instructor Notes in each lesson plan. These will provide key things to know about teaching that lesson plan. 

  * If there are any significant typos or issues with student activities, update them prior to class. Inform the curriculum team of any specific issues so that we can update for all classes.

* **Slides.** Review the slides before class. If you would like to make additions or edits to the slides, you will need to make a copy of the main file. 
  - During class, it is highly recommended to view the slide deck in the Google Slides browser. Exporting the slides to PowerPoint may cause formatting and incompatibility errors.

* **Time trackers.** Review time trackers before class.

* **Homework.** Always review homework before distributing it to students, especially if you've adjusted the curriculum throughout the week. If you find any issues, please notify the curriculum team via Slack.

  * Make sure students have the necessary knowledge and tools to complete the homework. While there may be expectations that students learn a new concept or tool during homework, the preceding classes should cover the preliminary knowledge needed to to learn any new and challenging concepts.

* **Student guides.** The students guide should be distributed prior to or at the beginning of each class. Students should have access to the student guide to reference during class and to review after class. Be wary of distributing these too far in advance—they are often updated in accordance with our lesson plan updates, so make sure to pull and distribute the latest versions.

* **Additional resources.** Remind students to review the additional resources linked in the unit READMEs, and feel free to find and share additional resources of your own.  


### Delivering Class 


#### Communication with Slack 

In your class Slack, create channels that students can use to ask questions during Instructor Dos and activities. Slack is an extremely important communication channel for online teaching, and you may have already created custom Slack channels. You can create additional channels to help manage the classroom and provide ongoing support to students during class time.

* At a minimum, you should have a #ClassQuestions channel. You can also create separate channels for different portions of the class, i.e., #ClassInstructorDo and #ClassActivities. 

* If a unit has extended group activities, ask fellow instructional staff to create custom group Slack channels to help group members communicate and share resources. There should be one channel per group. Staff can refer to the [Slack Documentation](https://slack.com/intl/en-es/resources/slack-101/create-new-channels) for guidance on creating channels and adding members.

#### Time Management

Time management is key to ensuring that all of the material in the lesson is covered. Use it wisely!

- Review time trackers during prep, and note where you may have to adjust times based on the skill level of your students. 

- Some topics lead to rich discussion. It's easy to lose track of time when this happens. If you discover you've lost track of time, consider the following:

   - First, if possible based on student skill levels, eliminate an in-class activity review. If you do this, be sure to ask students to review the solution file linked in their student guide.

   - Second, if it's not critical that an in-class activity be completed as a class, skip it. If you do this, be sure to ask students to review the activity file and solution file linked in their student guide.

- Shorten lecture times as much as possible to maximize time for interaction and activities.

- :alarm_clock: Check your time regularly, and ask other instructional staff to give you non-verbal cues if you're behind schedule. Zoom's raise hand feature is a good tool for reminding instructors to check the time.

- Give students frequent time warnings when they're working on activities. This helps them adjust their pace as needed. 


#### Ending a Class

- Make sure students have access to the student guide and any additional materials referenced in class that are not linked from the student guide file.  



### Office Hours
- Get strategic about how you host office hours. If office hours are crowded, try breaking the window into 10-15 minute blocks, and scheduling one student per block so you can give time to all students who need assistance.  

  - If your office hours are not well-attended, try proactively scheduling 10-15 minute meetings with each student over the course of the program, especially if they appear to be struggling in class. Use the time as a general check in, and to discuss class topics or industry and professional insights.

- You can also schedule topic-focused office hours. In class, note where students are struggling or have additional interest, and ask students what topics they'd like to review. Create structured office hours to focus on those topics.

  - :mega: Use a Slack poll to ask your students what they'd like to focus on in office hours (e.g. topic reviews, tool demos, etc.)
