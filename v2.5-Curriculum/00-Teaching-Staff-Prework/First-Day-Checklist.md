## Checklist for Your First Day

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

* **Slack**
    * You have access to the [Trilogy Ed Instructional Slack Team](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K6RN1FF/C0K6W8DCG). 
        * You can use this Slack workspace for easy, quick communication with our academic team, curriculum managers, SSMs, and the full international instructional community. 

    * You also have access to your Class Slack Team (cohort-specific links). 
        * Use this Slack workspace for easy, quick communication with your students. Your SSM will add you to this team. 


* **GitHub**
    * You’re using it now! This is where the class curriculum lives. 

    * Remember, you need to run `git pull` every time you access this repo in order to get the latest content.

    * Please also run `git pull` before every class.

* **GitLab**
    * GitLab is where the class repo lives and where students access material. 

    * You will move (push) all student-facing files and directories, such as activity files, solution files, student guides, homework files, and slides to GitLab (class repo) from GitHub (curriculum repo) prior to and during each class.

    * You should have an email invite for GitLab. Check your spam folder if you don't see it in your inbox.
        * **Note**: Harvard, Rutgers, University of Texas, and UCF do not use GitLab. If you're teaching with one of these schools, you will receive a university-specific GitHub invitation that contains your class repo.

* [**Bootcamp Spot**](https://www.bootcampspot.com/login)
    - Bootcamp Spot is an in-house learning management system that contains the syllabus, class attendance, homework submissions, Panopto videos, student profiles, and student survey feedback. 

For more details on these tools, please refer to your Instructor Onboarding course. If you have any issues using them, please contact your SSM for assistance.
